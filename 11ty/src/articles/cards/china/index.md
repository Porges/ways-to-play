As the probable country of origin of playing cards, China has a long history of
card-playing and many different varieties.

The pan-Chinese word for playing cards, <span lang="zh">牌</span> (Standard
Chinese: {%pronounce lang="zh-Latn" word="pái" pronouncer="LofZRules"
file="pronunciation_zh_牌.mp3" %}), does not distinguish between different forms
of card-like games and equally applies to paper or cardboard cards, bamboo
sticks, or bone, ivory, or plastic Mahjong tiles. In many adjacent countries the
term has been adopted to into the local language:

* Burmese: <span lang="my">ဖဲ</span> (<span lang="my-Latn">hpai</span>)
* Khmer: <span lang="km">បៀ</span> ({% pronounce lang="km-Latn" word="bie"

* Thai: <span lang="th">ไพ่</span> ({% pronounce lang="th-Latn" word="pâi"
  file="pronunciation_th_ไพ.mp3" pronouncer="Ghee" %})
