<p class="lead">Mill games are a family of boardgames also known as <i>Morris</i> or
<i>Merels</i> games. The main aim of any mill game is to try to form a row of
three pieces, which is called a ‘mill’, and which usually allows the player to
remove one of the opponent’s pieces from the board (usually not from another
mill).</p>

<!-- excerpt -->

Most mill games are split into two phases of <i>placement</i> and
<i>movement</i>, so that all pieces are placed on the board before any pieces
are moved.

## Games

Many of the games overlap so much that they could be considered to be the same
game. For example, {% gameref morabaraba %} as standardized by Mind Sports
South Africa has only two small differences from {% gameref twelve-mens-morris
%} as standardized by the <Noun lang="de">Weltmühlespiel Dachverband</Noun>.
However, I have chosen to describe it separately due to the interesting history
and cultural context around the game.

The most important representative of the type is {% gameref nine-mens-morris %},
and it is a good place to start if you have never played this type of game
before.

### Games on the large mill board

* {% gameref morabaraba %} is a mill game played competitively in South Africa. It differs slightly from Twelve Men’s Morris.
* {% gameref nine-mens-morris %} is the most well-known, and can be viewed as the stereotypical mill game. Many variants are described on this page.
* {% gameref twelve-mens-morris %} is the most common form in the United States. Eleven Men’s Morris is a variant with one fewer piece per player.
* {% gameref shax %} is a mill game from Somalia. It is distinguished by not permitting capturing during the placement phase.

### Games on the medium mill board

* {% gameref achi %} is a game from West Africa that features an additional way to form a mill.
* [Five Men’s Morris] or [Six Men’s Morris] is a mid-sized version that is less common than the bigger or smaller games.

### Games on the small mill board

* {% gameref three-mens-morris %} is a simple mill game that is known around the world.
* {% gameref tic-tac-toe %} can be viewed as a degenerate mill game (and could derive from Three Men’s Morris?)

### Other mill boards

* {% gameref tri-hex %} uses a non-standard board derived from that of tic-tac-toe.
