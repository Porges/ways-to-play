is a large Japanese population. They are mostly used to play matching or
set-collecting games, but they can also be used for complex gambling games.

### History

[Hanafuda]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} cards first appeared in Japan in the
early 19th century, during the [Edo]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} period
(1603–1868). [Edo]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} culture was heavily influenced
by the aristocratic culture of the earlier [Heian]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}
period (794–1185). As such, the cards abound with references to
[Heian]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} period literature, festivals, and artistic
tropes: 

> With the exception of the peony, which entered the poetic canon in the
> [Edo]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} period, all the images are from classical
> poetry of the [Heian]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} period and reflect urban
> commoners’ knowledge of the poetic and cultural associations of the months.
> [@4Seasons, loc. 1739–1741]

Artistically, the cards derive from the [kachōga]{lang="ja-Latn"}
([花鳥画]{lang="ja"} ‘flower and bird painting’) tradition. Artworks in this
style often have poems written upon them, and these appear on some cards of
the [Echigo-bana]{lang="ja-Latn"} pattern.

[Hanafuda]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} were banned as part of widespread
restrictions on gambling that were introduced by the [Kansei]{lang="ja-Latn"
.proper-noun} Reforms (1789–1801).^[In particular, gambling was prohibited by
the [博奕賭ノ勝負禁止ノ儀ニ付触書]{lang="ja"}, promulgated by Matsudaira
Sadanobu on the 12th of January, 1788 [@SatireWithinKibyōshi, p. 44].] This ban
was not lifted until 1886, and the company that was later to become
[Nintendo]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} began producing
[Hanafuda]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} cards in 1889.

### Composition of the deck

[Hanafuda]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} decks comprise 12 ‘suits’ of 4 cards
each, giving 48 cards total. Each suit corresponds to a month, and is
represented on the cards by a plant related to that month.

While nominally the cards start in ‘January’, at the time the deck was created
Japan’s calendar was based upon the lunisolar Chinese calendar, which started in
what is now February. This explains why ‘March’ is the month of the cherry
blossom when—according to the current calendar—it should be April,^[In Kyoto
from the 11th to 13th centuries, the average peak of the cherry blossom season
was April 17th [@4Seasons, loc. 484].] and why ‘August’ shows the full moon when
the full moon festival ([月見]{lang="ja"} <audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_月見.mp3"></audio><span
lang="ja-Latn" class="pronunciation"
onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">tsukimi</span>) actually
falls in September–October. 

However, even with these modifications the 11th (willow) and 12th (paulownia)
cards are in the wrong place. The 11th month depicts rain, willows, and a frog,
all of which are associated with summer.

In Korean and some Hawaiian decks, the months of November & December are
switched. This rarely makes a difference except when the cards are being used as
stand-ins for numeric cards (in gambling games).
 
#### Types of card

The deck is divided into four categories of card. In descending order of value,
there are:

<figure class="small"><img itemscope="itemscope"
itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image"
src="/images/5_brights-small.jpg" alt="TODO"/> <figcaption>The five bright
cards, from a standard [Nintendo]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}
deck.</figcaption></figure>
  
* 5 ‘bright’ ([光]{lang="ja"} <audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_光.mp3"></audio><span
lang="ja-Latn" class="pronunciation"
onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">hikari</span>) cards. In some decks,
  especially Korean ones, these are marked with the 光 character for ease of
  identification.^[[Maeda Masabumi]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} ([前田???]{lang="ja"}) of the
  manufacturer [Ōishi Tengudō]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} has stated that this
  was actually a trademark-like feature that they used, which was picked up by
  the Korean manufacturers as a standardized marking [@ModernKoreanCards].] The
  five bright cards are: 
  - the crane with pine (January)
  - the cherry blossom curtain (March)
  - the full moon (August)
  - the rain man (November)
  - the phoenix (December)

itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemprop="image"
src="/images/5_brights_kr-small.jpg" alt="TODO"/> <figcaption>The five bright
cards, from a Korean Clown brand deck.</figcaption></figure>
  
* 9 ‘species’ ([種]{lang="ja"} <audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_種.mp3"></audio><span
lang="ja-Latn" class="pronunciation"
onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">tane</span>) cards. These feature
  animals, but also a sake cup, and the ‘eight-planked bridge’.
* 10 ‘scroll’ ([短冊]{lang="ja"} <audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_短冊.mp3"></audio><span
lang="ja-Latn" class="pronunciation"
onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">tanzaku</span> cards. These are the
  cards with the coloured ‘scrolls’ on them. Small pieces of paper were used to
  write poems on at poetry competitions (see the image below). For some games
  these are further subdivided into three sub-groups: scrolls with writing,
  plain red scrolls, and plain blue/purple scrolls.
* 24 ‘dregs’ ([カス]{lang="ja"} [kasu]{lang="ja-Latn"}) or ‘junk’ cards. This
  is everything that isn’t in one of the previous categories.

In many games these cards will carry point values of 20, 10, 5, and 1, but this
can vary. In some modern decks these values are printed on the cards.

Korean decks often contain extra (up to 6) joker cards.

### Patterns

#### Standard

The standard pattern is now one that is called
[八八花]{lang="ja"}/[八々花]{lang="ja"} <audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_八八花.mp3"></audio><span lang="ja-Latn"
class="pronunciation"
onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">hachi&shy;hachi&shy;bana</span>, as it is
used to play the game [八八]{lang="ja"} ‘88’. Almost all decks use this pattern,
and images of it are shown below.

Korean decks also use the standard [hachi&shy;hachi&shy;bana]{lang="ja-Latn"}
pattern, but the ribbons are usually blue instead of purple, and bear Korean
text.

#### [Echigo-bana]{lang="ja-Latn"}

The regional <audio src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_越後花.mp3"></audio><span
lang="ja-Latn" class="pronunciation"
onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">Echigo-bana</span> ([越後花]{lang="ja"}
‘Echigo flowers’) pattern is based on designs that are older than the standard
pattern. The most obvious difference is that all the cards are overpainted with
gold and silver in various patterns.

Some of the junk cards also carry short poems ([短歌]{lang="ja"}
<audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_短歌.mp3"></audio><span
lang="ja-Latn" class="pronunciation"
onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">tanka</span>). Poetry is a common sight on traditional Japanese
art—as seen on the prints above—and often provides more context to the images.
The poems of the [Echigo-bana]{lang="ja-Latn"} will be explained below.

#### [Awa&shy;bana]{lang="ja-Latn"}/[Kintoki&shy;bana]{lang="ja-Latn"}

This is another regional pattern called [阿波花]{lang="ja"}
[Awa&shy;bana]{lang="ja-Latn"} or [金時花]{lang="ja"} [Kintoki&shy;bana]{lang="ja-Latn"}.
It originated in [Awa]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} province, in what is now
[Tokushima]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} prefecture.

#### Modern/Novelty decks

In addition to the traditional standard patterns, there are also many modern
revisions or novelty decks that can be found.

The cards for January feature pine trees. There is one bright card, one scroll
card (with text), and two junk cards. 

The text on the scroll reads [akayoroshi]{lang="ja-Latn"}
[あ𛀙よろし]{lang="ja"}.^[The card uses a rare [hentaigana]{lang="ja-Latn"}
character for [ka]{lang="ja-Latn"}, which is usually written [か]{lang="ja"}.
It may not render correctly on your device.] The meaning of this phrase is
unclear, even to [Hanafuda]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} manufacturers, but it
may be something like ‘clearly the best’.

The cards for February feature plum trees in blossom. There is one species card,
one scroll card (with text), and two junk cards. The text on the scroll is the
same as that on January’s.

Before cherry blossoms overtook them in popularity during the Heian period, plum
blossoms were most prized for viewing in spring. They had originally been
introduced from China.

The text on the scroll reads [miyoshino]{lang="ja-Latn"} [みよしの]{lang="ja"}
‘beautiful [Yoshino]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}’. This is a reference to the
mountainous area of [Yoshino]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} ([吉野]{lang="ja"})
in [Nara]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} prefecture, which is famous for its
cherry blossoms.

The cards for April show the drooping branches of wisteria. They are also
nicknamed ‘black bean’ ([黒豆]{lang="ja"} <audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_黒豆.mp3"></audio><span lang="ja-Latn"
class="pronunciation" onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">kuromame</span>).
There is one species card, one red scroll card, and two junk cards.

This month shows the transition from spring to summer; the lesser cuckoo
([ホトトギス]{lang="ja"} <audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_ホトトギス.mp3"></audio><span lang="ja-Latn"
class="pronunciation" onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">hototogisu</span>)
is a bird of summer [@4Seasons, loc. 1065], while wisteria is associated with
the end of spring [@4Seasons, loc. 1021].

The cuckoo swooping in front of the moon is a common motif in Japanese
art.^[This may be a reference to the tale of [Yorimasa]{lang="ja-Latn"
.proper-noun} from the [Heike Monogatari]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}, but
I cannot be sure about that [@HeikeMonogatari, pp. 161–163].]

The [tanka]{lang="ja-Latn"} on the junk cards is similar to Poem 135 from the
Summer section of the [Kokinshū]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}, except that the
last line starts with [ima ya]{lang="ja-Latn"} [今や]{lang="ja"} instead of [itu
ka]{lang="ja-Latn"} [いつか]{lang="ja"} [@PoemsOfTheEchigobana, p. 100].

This poem (perhaps written by [Kakinomoto no Hitomaro]{lang="ja-Latn"
.proper-noun} [柿本 人麻呂]{lang="ja"}) again focuses on the transition from
spring (represented by wisteria) to summer (represented by the arrival of the
cuckoo):

The cards for May depict iris flowers. There is one species card, one red scroll
card, and two junk cards.

The bridge shown on the species card is a reference to the ‘eight bridges’
([八橋]{lang="ja"} <audio src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_八橋.mp3"></audio><span
lang="ja-Latn" class="pronunciation"
onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">yatsuhashi</span>) featured in an episode
of the <cite>Tales of Ise</cite> (<cite lang="ja">伊勢物語</cite> [Ise
monogatari]{lang="ja-Latn"}), in which the unnamed protagonist of the
story^[Traditionally this is presumed to be the poet [Ariwara no
Narihira]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} ([在原 業平]{lang="ja"}).] comes across
a braided river that is crossed by eight overlapping planks forming a zig-zag
bridge. Challenged to compose a poem on the subject “a traveller’s sentiments”,
he recites the following:

<div class="multi"><p lang="ja"
class="vertical-rl"><b>か</b>らごろも<br/><b>き</b>つつなれにし<br/><b>つ</b>ましあれば<br/><b>は</b>るばるきぬる<br/><b>た</b>びをしぞおもふ</p>

This poem, which appears in full on the junk cards of the
[Echigo-bana]{lang="ja-Latn"} pattern [@PoemsOfTheEchigobana, p. 100], is in the
form of an acrostic; the first letters of each line spell out
[kakitsuhata]{lang="ja-Latn"} [かきつはた]{lang="ja"}, which is a reference to
the name of the Japanese iris <audio

The cards for July show bush clover. They are also nicknamed ‘red bean’
([赤豆]{lang="ja"} [akamame]{lang="ja-Latn"}/[小豆]{lang="ja"} <audio

class="pronunciation" onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">azuki</span>).
There is one species card, one red scroll card, and two junk cards.

Bush clover is very strongly associated with autumn—the Japanese character
[萩]{lang="ja"} is a composition of [秋]{lang="ja"} ‘autumn’ and [艹]{lang="ja"}
(full form [艸]{lang="ja"}) ‘grass’.

<!-- Deer is associated with bush clover but instead we have a boar? But also
deer are renowned for being separated from their lovers... -->

The cards for August show waving fields of miscanthus, also known as
silvergrass. There is one bright card, one species card, and two junk cards.

On printed cards, the fields of grass are often simplified into solid black
circles. This has led to the nickname of ‘baldy’ ([坊主]{lang="ja"}
<audio src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_坊主.mp3"></audio><span lang="ja-Latn" class="pronunciation" onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">bōzu</span>) for the cards of August.

@PoemsOfTheEchigobana [p. 101] says that the poem on the
[Echigo-bana]{lang="ja-Latn"} junk cards is “untranslatable”, because it has
been corrupted. His contact believes it is meant to be poem 422 of the [Shin
Kokinshū]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}, or perhaps a revision of it:

<div class="multi"><p lang="ja"

</p><p>Its destination:<br/> The skies, one with<br/> Musashi Plain, where<br/>

The cards for September show chrysanthemums. There is one species card, one
blue/purple scroll card, and two junk cards.

The species card appears to show the implements of <audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_重陽.mp3"></audio><span lang="ja-Latn"
class="pronunciation" onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">chōyō</span>
[重陽]{lang="ja"}, the chrysanthemum festival, which is held on the 9th day of
the 9th month. Because chrysanthemum blooms for a long time, it had become
a symbol of long life in China, and the festival was introduced into Japan by
the court of Emperor [Kanmu]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}
([桓武天皇]{lang="ja"}, 735–806) [@4Seasons, loc. 1214].^[A story invented by
Tendai monks in the 14th century [Taiheiki]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}
([太平記]{lang="ja"} ‘Chronicle of Great Peace’) provides retroactive
justification for the festival [@ChigoJapanese, pp. 958–959]: A boy banished to
a remote mountain writes out passages of the Buddhist Lotus Sūtra on
chrysanthemum flowers. Dew collecting on the flowers drips into the river from
which he drinks, and he goes on to live for 800 years without ageing a day.]

During the festival, chrysanthemum petals are added to sake and consumed. The
sake cup pictured on the card has the character [寿]{lang="ja"} (<audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_寿.mp3"></audio><span lang="ja-Latn"
class="pronunciation" onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">kotobuki</span>),
meaning ‘long life’, written in a cursive script.

A poem by [Bashō]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}, Japan’s most famed composer of
[hokku]{lang="ja-Latn"}, commemorates the evening of the 9th day of the 9th
month, in 1691. [Bashō]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} was staying at the temple
[Gichu-ji]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} ([義仲寺]{lang="ja"}) in a hermitage
known as ‘nameless hut’ ([無名庵]{lang="ja"} [Mumyō-an]{lang="ja-Latn"
.proper-noun}). His disciple [Kawai Otokuni]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}
([河合乙州]{lang="ja"}) came to visit him:

The cards for October show fallen maple leaves. There is one species card, one
blue/purple scroll card, and two junk cards.

While the leaves on the species card are attached to a tree, the leaves on the
other cards appear to be floating on water. This could be a reference to the
[Tatsuta]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} river ([竜田川]{lang="ja"}), which was as
famous for autumn foliage as [Yoshino]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} was for
cherry blossoms in the spring [@4Seasons, loc. 1756].

The poem on the [Echigo-bana]{lang="ja-Latn"} junk cards is number 437 from the
‘Autumn 2’ book of the [Shin Kokinshū]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}. It was
composed by [Fujiwara no Ietaka]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun}, upon the
finalization of the construction of the collection [@MakingShinkokinshu, p.

The cards for November show willow trees. There is one bright card, one species
card, one red scroll card, and one junk card, which is called the lightning
card or devil card ([鬼札]{lang="ja"} <audio
src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_鬼札.mp3"></audio><span lang="ja-Latn"
class="pronunciation" onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">onifuda</span>).

The month of November is also often referred to as ‘rain’ ([雨]{lang="ja"}
<audio src="/audio/pronunciation_ja_雨.mp3"></audio><span lang="ja-Latn"
class="pronunciation" onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">ame</span>). This
month has a strange relationship to the others—in many games they have special
powers, or they are valued lower than the cards of other months. For example,
the bright of November will often score less than the other four brights, and
in some games the lightning card has special powers.

The man pictured on the bright card is the poet [Ono no
Michikaze]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} ([小野道風]{lang="ja"}), who is
considered to be one of the founders of Japanese calligraphy. The jumping frog
recalls an episode in his life: he had failed seven times to achieve
a promotion, and was considering abandoning his attempts. One day, walking
beside a stream, he saw a frog attempting to jump onto a willow branch. Seven
times it jumped, and seven times it failed. On the eighth attempt, the frog
reached the branch successfully. [Michikaze]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} was
thus inspired to persevere [@AnimalInFarEasternArt, p. 86–87].

The phoenix ([鳳凰]{lang="ja"} <audio

class="pronunciation" onclick="this.previousSibling.play()">hōō</span>, or
[fènghuáng]{lang="zh-Latn"} in Chinese) featured on the bright card is from
Japanese mythology, and is particularly associated with the empress of Japan.
According to legend the phoenix will only land on a paulownia tree. What appear
to be ‘spikes’ on the card are really its long tail feathers.

The tree itself is associated with the prime minister’s office in Japan. In
(TODO), [Oishi Tengudo]{lang="ja-Latn" .proper-noun} produced a special deck for
the TODO Prime Minister. In addition, [Oishi Tengudo]{lang="ja-Latn"
.proper-noun} boxes many of their decks using Paulownia wood.

Usually (in Japanese decks) the manufacturer’s mark is on the coloured junk
card, much like the ace of spades is used in European decks. In Korea the mark
can also be on the full moon card, or on the jokers.

## Manufacturers

Many of these are taken from @ModernJapaneseWrappers and the manufacturers do
not exist any more. Angel, Nintendo, and Ōishi Tengudō are the main ones still
in business. Matsui Tengudō appears to have been the last manufacturer making
cards by hand [@SalterJapanese].
