### Four field Kono [네밭고누]{lang="ko"}

In Korean this is supposedly called <ruby lang="ko">네밭고누<rt
lang="ko-Latn">nebatgonu</rt></ruby>.^[@CulinOrient gives this as <ruby
lang="ko">네밧고노<rt lang="ko-Latn">nebasgono</rt></ruby>, which doesn’t match
the ‘nei-pat-ko-no’ transliteration in the text. The corrected version doesn’t
appear to be a true Korean game, so the origin of this is a mystery.]

In China it is called <ruby lang="zh">炮<rt lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">pào</rt>棋<rt
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qí</rt></ruby> ‘cannon chess’, as the pieces capture in the same
manner as the cannon piece in [Chinese chess][].
