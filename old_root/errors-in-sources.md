### ‘Nine Holes’

I don’t think that a board game by the name of ‘Nine Holes’ ever existed.
Indeed, Three Men’s Morris can be played on a board of nine holes, but I don’t
think that it was ever called by that name. All sources seem to agree that Nine
Holes was a bowling game, the same as the French [Trou-Madame]{lang="fr"}.

The myth seems to have started with Nares (TODO: citation for Glossary).


I have not found any other references for the game which do not originate with
Nares in some way.

Other sources hint at this as well; in @GommeI [p. 419], Forby is quoted as
saying: (TODO: cite directly)

> In Nares [morris] is said to be the same as nine-holes. With us it is
> certainly different.

Also, @OnTheIndoorGamesOfSchoolBoys [p. 321]:

> _Nine holes_ is sometimes mentioned, but I believe that to be the name of
> a game of a different kind.
