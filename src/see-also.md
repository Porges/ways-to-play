Aside from the others that are already cited in the [Bibliography](/bibliography/), these sites are worth visiting individually. I link them here also in an attempt to combat the loss of information over time; if any of these links stops working then they should still be able to be found on Internet Archive. Links to archives of now-dead sites are marked with †.
