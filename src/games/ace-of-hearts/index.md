<p class="lead">
<span class="aka">Ace of Hearts</span>, also known as <span class="aka">Fair Chance</span>, was a roulette-like gambling game played in England in the 18th century.[@OfTheLawsOfChance p. 74]
</p>

It was explicitly banned by the <cite>Gaming Act 1738</cite> (<cite>12 Geo. II., c. 28</cite>) of George <span class="rnum">II</span>, but outside of that law it appears to be little-mentioned.
