<p class="lead"><span lang="fil" class="noun aka">Prinola</span> is a {%a staking-games,simple staking game%} that used to be played in the Philippines. The name is derived from the Spanish <span lang="es">pirinola</span>, a spinning-top or teetotum.</p>

The only source I have found for the game is that of Stewart Culin. He also says the same game is played in China under the name <span lang="yue" class="aka">車咩</span> (‘teetotum’, Cantonese: <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping" class="aka">ce¹ me¹</span>).[@ChineseGames p. 496]{%fn%}Culin transliterates this as <span lang="yue-Latn" class="aka">ch’é mé</span>.{%endfn%}

<span lang="fil-Latn" class="noun">Prinola</span> is played using a staking layout containing symbols for the dice results {%cdice 1%} through {%cdice 6%}, and a six-sided teetotum. The teetotum is usually spun in a shallow dish.

Alternately, the teetotum can also be decorated with animals or other images, in much the same way as the Chinese versions of {%gameref crown-and-anchor%}.

### Play

Players place their stakes on any of the partitions on the layout. The banker then spins the teetotum. Any players who selected the square that the teetotum shows win 4× their stake. All other stakes are lost.

In Indonesia the game has been called {%pronounce lang="id" word="Dadu Putar" class="noun aka" pronouncer="ronaldhoesni" file="pronunciation_ind_dadu_putar.mp3" %} (‘spinning die’), and was popular amongst Javanese labourers and miners.[@GamesAndDances p. 330] The top would be covered with a coconut shell or specially-made wooden cover whilst it was spinning. Evidence found online shows that the game is still played in this manner today.

## <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Chobo-Ichi</span>

The Japanese game of <span lang="ja-Latn" class="aka noun">Chobo-Ichi</span> (<span lang="ja" class="aka">樗蒲一</span>) is the same but played with a single die instead of a teetotum. The name means something like “gamble on one outcome”.

In 1784 this game had become so popular that gambling sheds running the game lined the street for a whole [<span lang="ja-Latn">ri</span> (<span lang="ja">里</span>)](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%87%8C#Etymology_2_2) — nearly 4&nbsp;km — from Asakusa to Senju in Tokyo.[@ADiceyHistory]

The players place their bets upon the staking layout, then the banker rolls the die. Any players who bet upon the side that comes up win, and are paid 4× their stake. All other players lose their bets.
