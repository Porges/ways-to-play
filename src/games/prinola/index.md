<p class="lead"><span lang="fil" class="noun">Prinola</span> is a <a href="/articles/staking-games/">simple staking game</a> that
used to be played in the Philippines. The name is derived from the Spanish <span
lang="es">pirinola</span>, a spinning-top or teetotum.</p>

The only source I have found for the game is that of Stewart Culin. He also says
the same game is played in China under the name <span lang="yue">車咩</span>
(‘teetotum’, Cantonese: <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">ce1 me1</span>).[@ChineseGames p.
496]{%fn%}Culin transliterates this as <span lang="yue-Latn">ch’é
mé</span>.{%endfn%}

<span lang="fil-Latn" class="noun">Prinola</span> is played using a staking
layout containing symbols for the dice results {%cdice 1%} through {%cdice 6%},
and a six-sided teetotum. The teetotum is usually spun in a shallow dish.

Alternately, the teetotum can also be decorated with animals or other images, in
much the same way as the Chinese versions of {%gameref crown-and-anchor%}.

### Play

Players place their stakes on any of the partitions on the layout. The banker
then spins the teetotum. Any players who selected the square that the teetotum
shows win 4× their stake. All other stakes are lost.
