this further proves the Cantonese origin of the game (see e.g.
@SparrowAndPigeon, although I find some of his other (original) conclusions to
be dubious).{%endfn%}) is a gambling game which originated in <span class="noun"
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Guangdong</span> during the late Qing dynasty, and which in the
19th and 20th centuries was spread throughout Oceania-bordering countries by
Chinese emigrants. 

The history of the game is sadly a well-trodden story of racism and hypocrisy:
as a Chinese gambling game, Chinese migrants were punished while gambling games
played by Europeans were permitted. Later the game was adapted by Americans who
profited from a now-legal game even as the Chinese game was suppressed.
Eventually, the game became known under the modern name of Keno, now played in
casinos around the world.

<!-- excerpt -->

In European sources, the game is often referred to as simply “the Chinese
lottery”. The transliteration of the game is usually given as “pak-a-poo” (most
common in New Zealand) or “pak-a(h)-pu” (most common in Australia). In London
(particularly centered around the Chinese community in Pennyfields, Poplar) it
was referred to as “puk-a-pu” or “puk-a-poo”, and in South Africa
“pa-ka-pu”.[@TheBantuInTheCity p. 423] Other variants are
“pak-a-peu”,[@PakAPeuAtLawrence] “puck-a-pu”, “pukka-poo”, or “pac-a-poo”. In
Macau it is given with the Portugeuse romanization of “pacapio”, which remains
standard in current usage (previous terms include <span
lang="pt">p’u-pio</span>[@ACidadeMaisPitoresca]). In the USA it became at first “boc hop
bu”[@NYTimes18870127] before picking up a variety of the other names, but in
Hawaiʻi it was referred to as “pakapio”.[@Pakapio]

While the specifics vary, the play of the game is simple: each player purchases
one or more tickets upon which they mark some set of characters out of the
eighty that are printed on the ticket. The seller or “bank” then randomly
selects a given number of characters, and players win money according to the
number of matching characters they have marked on their ticket. The specific
numbers of characters chosen and the permissible bets vary by both time and
location.

## Early origins

It is sometimes fancifully claimed that the name of the game was because
originally white pigeons were used to choose winning tickets, but that is not
possible given the way the game is played; it is not a lottery where one or more
tickets are selected to be the winner(s).

The game seems to have originated from gambling on the early-Qing “white pigeon
festival” (<span lang="zh-Hant">白鴿會</span> Cantonese: <span
lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">baak6 gap3 wui2</span>) which was held in Guangdong. Pigeons
were raced from [Qingyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingyuan) (<span
lang="zh">清遠</span>) to [Foshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foshan) (<span
lang="zh">佛山</span>), and groups of pigeons were numbered using the opening
characters from the [<cite>Thousand Character
Classic</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Character_Classic) (<span
lang="zh">千字文</span>).{%fn%}This system of enumeration has also been used to
number volumes of books and other objects.{%endfn%} Bets were made on which
group of pigeons would return intact.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 84] Eventually the
pigeons were dropped entirely and a game was developed based on characters begin
drawn at random.

<!--
According to some Chinese dictionaries, the game was a derivative of
pigeon-racing bets. The story goes that the characters were originally used to
label pigeons, and players would select which pigeons to bet upon based on the
characters assigned to those pigeons, and eventually, the pigeons were dropped
entirely, with the characters being drawn at random. However, there is no record
of pigeon races and betting being performed in this manner.[@SparrowAndPigeon]

## Known history

According to the [<cite>Draft History of <span class="noun"
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Qing</span></cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_History_of_Qing),[@QinYingChapter]
the official <span class="noun" lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Qin Ying</span> (<span lang="zh">秦瀛</span>,
1743–1821) banned pigeon tickets in Guangdong in the “ninth year of [<span class="noun"
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Jiaqing</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaqing_Emperor)”
(1804/5), so the game must have existed at this point.[@SparrowAndPigeon]

In 1849, a traveller from Yunnan province visited Guangdong and reported that:

> In the western part of the provincial capital Guangzhou, people in Henan area
> developed cunning ways to operate the “white pigeon” lottery. Even women and
> children were addicted to the game. The former governor of Guangdong
> considered the “white pigeon” lottery to have been going out of control so he
> prohibited it. When this governor got promoted and left, the trend of playing
> the lottery came back.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 64]

GT translation:

Although the second text above makes the numbering format of racing pigeons more specific and is the same as the numbering format of "White Pigeon Tickets" in "Thousand Characters", it further exposes the theory that it is a fiction attached to later generations. This is because it does not cite any evidence of the provenance, and the undocumented pigeon numbering system originated in the late Qing Dynasty, obviously much later than the "white pigeon ticket" that appeared before the middle of the Qing Dynasty. According to Zhao Lifeng from "Drafts of Qing History. According to the textual research of Qin Ying Biography: "In the ninth year of Jiaqing, Qin Ying banned white pigeon tickets in Guangdong", "it seems to be presumed that the white pigeon tickets were produced during the Qianlong period". (22) Therefore, the second article cited above can also be judged as a purely contrived misrepresentation. Although such articles are conclusive and well-founded on the surface, they are in fact unfounded claims. Therefore, the "white pigeon ticket" being edited by "Wikipedia" indicates that the source of this source is yet to be found, and its text is as follows:

… later part

In fact, according to the description of "Qin Ying banned white pigeon tickets in Guangdong in the ninth year of Jiaqing", which was verified by Zhao Lifeng, it can be inferred that in the ninth year of Jiaqing (February 11, 1804 - January 30, 1805), there were already white pigeons in Guangdong. The pigeon ticket was passed down from Macau. This is because in fact, during the Qianjia period, government officials at all levels, including Guangdong Province, Guangzhou Prefecture, Xiangshan County, etc., had repeatedly ordered Macau's Portuguese leader "Yimu" to prohibit the "gambling incidents" of Chinese and foreign residents in Macau. (42) Although the relevant materials do not clearly mention the way of “gathering”, the author believes that these “gaming events” should be the Western lottery introduced by Portugal and the Chinese lottery inspired by the Chinese. That is caused by the white pigeon ticket. For example, on the seventh day of the third lunar month in the tenth year of Jiaqing (April 6, 1805), Peng Zhaolin, the magistrate of Xiangshan, once investigated the "event of opening bids and gathering gambling by Tibetan merchants", and issued a notice saying: "If people gather to open bids, People who are tempted to invest in silver to buy bids are prohibited from doing so. […] If you dare to disobey and do not comply, and there are still people gathering to open bids, the county will visit the real case, and it will definitely be investigated and dealt with strictly in accordance with Daxian. (43) From the text of the ban, it can be inferred that the “Fan merchants opening bids and gathering gambling incident” had already happened, and was only known by the magistrate far away in Xiangshan County and ordered the ban. Since the lottery issued by the Hall of Mercy began in 1810, it is not Lottery of the Hall of Mercy. The "bid" of "bid opening" and "buying bid" mentioned in the article should be the abbreviation of "white dove label (ticket)". The Portuguese name of the Macau Government Gazette on the 22nd is “Lotaria de China”, which means “Chinese lottery”.(44) It can be seen that the “white pigeon label (ticket)” is a product of Portuguese lottery principles and then transformed by Chinese methods. , so it is called "Chinese lottery" or "Chinese lottery". Moreover, pigeons are mostly gray, brown, white, etc. are a few, and pigeons are generally referred to as "white pigeons", which is a unique phenomenon in Cantonese and Cantonese. It is called "鹁ge" as a result of the transliteration.(45) And the pronunciation of "Piao" as "Biao" is also a phenomenon still preserved in Cantonese dialects. “Bid (ticket)”, and winning the betting ticket is “Zhongma Biao (ticket)”. It is enough to prove that “White Pigeon Bid (ticket)”, a “Chinese lottery” or “Chinese lottery” originated from Portuguese lottery and originated in Guangdong and Macau The lottery was created and officially named by the Cantonese.

    The second text above, although the numbering form of racing pigeons is more specific and the same as the numbering form of the "White Pigeon Ticket" in the "Thousand Characters", further reveals that it is a posthumous fabrication.

This is because although these articles are all well documented and apparently justifiable, they are in fact untraceable and assumed. Therefore, Wikipedia is editing the "pigeon ticket" note to find the origin of this source, the text is as follows.

… much later:

    In fact, according to Zhao Lifeng's testimony that "Qin Ying banned white pigeon tickets in Guangdong in the ninth year of Jiaqing", it can be assumed that white pigeon tickets existed in Guangdong in the ninth year of Jiaqing (February 11, 1804-January 30, 1805) and were transmitted from Macao. This is because, in fact, during the Qian-Jia period, Chinese officials at various levels of government in Guangdong Province, Guangzhou Prefecture, and Xiangshan County repeatedly ordered the Portuguese chiefs of Macau, the "yi mu", to prohibit "gambling events" among the Chinese and foreign residents of Macau. (42) Although the information does not explicitly mention the name of the "gambling events", the author, after a comprehensive study, believes that these "gambling events" were caused by the introduction of the Western lottery from Portugal and the Chinese lottery, or pigeon tickets, which were inspired by the Chinese. For example, on the seventh day of the third month of the tenth year of Jiaqing (April 6, 1805), Peng Zhaolin, the governor of Xiangshan, investigated "the incident of the gambling of the foreign merchants by opening bids," issuing a circular saying: "If the people are confused to buy the bids by opening bids, they are forbidden to do so. [If you do not comply with the law, or if you still have a case of crowded bidding, the county will visit the case and report it to the Grand Constabulary for investigation and serious punishment." (43) From the text of this prohibition, it can be inferred that "the incident of the lottery of a foreign merchant" had already occurred and was prohibited by order of the county magistrate who was far away from Xiangshan County. Since the lottery was first issued in 1810, it is clear that this was not a lottery for Ren Ci Tang. The "bid" mentioned in the article for "opening" and "buying" is an abbreviation of "white pigeon bid (ticket)". The name of the "Pigeon Ticket" in the Macao Government Gazette of May 22, 1872 is "Lotaria de China", which means "Chinese Lottery". (44) It can be seen that the "Lotaria de China" is a Chinese lottery. (44) It can be seen that the "white pigeon (ticket)" is a product of the Portuguese lottery principle and then modified in the Chinese way, so it is called "Chinese lottery" or "Chinese lottery". Moreover, pigeons are mostly gray, with brown and white being the minority. The common name for pigeons as "white pigeons" is unique to Cantonese, and is the result of a phonetic change from the ancient name for pigeons, "卧式鴿". (45) The pronunciation or writing of "ticket" as "biao" is also a phenomenon still retained in the Cantonese dialect. For example, in Hong Kong, the Cantonese language still refers to "horse tickets" as "馬標 (ticket)" and "winning horse tickets" as "中馬標 (ticket)". This proves that the "Chinese lottery" or "Chinese lottery", which originated from the Portuguese lottery and was created in Macau, Guangdong, was created and officially named by the Cantonese.

What we _do_ know for sure is that it was first legalized in Macau by [<span class="noun"
lang="pt">João Maria Ferreira do
Amaral</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Maria_Ferreira_do_Amaral)
(1803–1849), who authorized the game in January 1847 upon the request of local
Chinese businessmen.[@GamesOfChanceInMacau2 p. 110] Macau had been declared a
free port in 1845, hoping to increase trade and business under competition from
the recently-established British colony at Hong Kong (1842). Despite this, Macau
was still in decline and Amaral was under pressure to raise revenue. Attempts by
Amaral to introduce new taxes were unpopular and had even led to [an armed
revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Faiti%C3%B5es) in October
1846. Thus, a system was devised whereby monopoly rights for important goods
(including pork and beef, fish, salt, oysters and opium) were sold or auctioned
off.  Gambling monopolies were a logical extension of this idea. 

The Macau Senate were unhappy with a number of the decisions made by the
governor, and complained directly to Lisbon that, among other things, 

> … the Chinese were given license to operate lotteries inside the city, a thing
> that the same Government which allowed it had just two months before forbidden
> as immoral and harmful to peacefulness and public tranquility.[@GamesOfChanceInMacau2 p. 110]

Nevertheless, the game was permitted to continue and licenses to run <span
lang="pt">pacapio</span> began to be issued on an annual basis from April 5,
1848. The game is still played today in Macau, but it is not very
popular.{%fn%}A study in 2019 found that only 4 out of 855 (0.5%) of gamblers
had played the game in the last 12 months.[@SegmentingChineseGamblers]{%endfn%}

## The Game

The primary artifact of the game is the *ticket*, a slip of paper upon which is
printed the name of the bank (see below) and 80 unique Chinese characters. These
characters are the first 80 taken from the [<cite>Thousand Character
Classic</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Character_Classic) (<span
lang="zh">千字文</span>), and are always printed in a top-down, right-to-left
order, broken into four-character blocks:

<blockquote lang="zh" class="vertical-rl mx-auto blockquote">
天地玄黄&#x3000;宇宙洪荒<br/>
囸月盈昃&#x3000;辰宿列張<br/>
寒來暑徃&#x3000;秋收冬藏<br/>

</blockquote>

A striking thing about this layout is just how consistent it was across all
countries where the game was played. A ticket used in Nevada is almost identical
to one used in Victoria (Australia) or Otago (New Zealand). Tickets were printed
locally,{%fn%}The National Library of New Zealand has [at least 10 pakapoo
printing blocks](https://tiaki.natlib.govt.nz/#details=ecatalogue.470454), and
another photo [documents the movement of a printing
press](https://tiaki.natlib.govt.nz/#details=ecatalogue.949016) that was
originally used by one Joe Quinn to print pakapoo tickets in
Wellington.{%endfn%} as well as exported from China to other
countries.{%fn%}See, for example, [this
ticket](https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/chinesecanadianstories/gri/items/1.0367497)
which is explicitly printed “Made in China”. [Other
tickets](https://oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb3j49n63p/?docId=hb3j49n63p&order=7&brand=oac4&layout=printable-details)
show evidence that the bank name was stamped onto the ticket at some stage later
than the character grid was printed. Stewart Culin also describes how tickets
were shipped from China in “large quantities”.[@ChineseInAmerica p. 7]{%endfn%}
Tickets often bore the phrase <span lang="zh">照來原底給</span> “printed
according to the original”, so fidelity to the ideal form of the ticket was
apparently sought-after.

<!--
Guidebooks such as <cite lang="zh">票圖撮要</cite> (<cite>Essentials of the
Lottery</cite>, 1894) were also published, with instructions on how to calculate
payouts for various forms of tickets.

meaning “an expert in making money”, a reference to an extract from the

{%imageEnd%}

The place that distributed the winnings and collected the profits was invariably
referred to as the “bank”, and each bank would have its own name. In places such
as California, where [<span

(<span lang="zh">堂</span>) were established, the banks would often be tied to a
particular <span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">tong</span>.[@EncyclopediaOfKeno p. 8]

There were different ways to select the winning numbers. The drawing of numbers
was performed publicly to assure bettors that the game was fair. A Sydney
newspaper report of a court case from 1886 gives the following method:{%fn%}The
same method is described in Melbourne in 1876.[@InAChineseLotteryShop p.
7]{%endfn%} 80 pieces of paper with one character each were rolled up and then
mixed in a jar. From this jar, the pieces of paper were divided into four bowls,
giving 20 tickets per bowl. Next, four pieces of wood engraved with a character each
and then wrapped in paper (to hide the characters) were randomly placed, one in
each bowl. Four pieces of paper with matching characters were rolled up and
presented to an onlooker to select one, and the wooden pieces were unwrapped to
reveal their characters and find the matching bowl. The 20 winning numbers from
this bowl were then read out.[@ChineseGamblingInSydney]

The area where the tickets were to be drawn, and where the bank’s capital was
kept, was usually separated from onlookers by wooden bars.

The game traveled everywhere that Chinese people migrated to. In particular, it
seems to have been popular in places with goldfields where Chinese men came to
work in the late 19th century: San Francisco in the USA, British Columbia in
Canada, Victoria in Australia, and New Zealand.

According to @EncyclopediaOfKeno, the game was introduced to the Western United
States in the mid-19th century, and had reached the Eastern cities by 1870. 

Mentions of “Chinese lotteries” begin to appear in Californian newspapers from
the 1860s, and sometime around 1863 Mark Twain mentioned the game in a report
for Nevada’s <cite>Territorial Enterprise</cite>, noting its popularity in that
“about every third Chinaman runs a lottery”, and that “we could not see that
these lotteries differed in any respect from our own… the manner of drawing is
similar to ours”.[@RoughingIt p. 396]

According to Stewart Culin[@ChineseInAmerica p. 11], by 1886 four banks were
operating in Philadelphia{%fn%}He provides the names “Extensive Increase” (<span

### In Australia

Chinese lotteries are first discussed in Australian newspapers in the 1860s;
pak-a-pu is clearly described in one article of 1863.[@TheChineseLottery1863]
The game seems to have first appeared in the [goldfields of
Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfields_region_of_Victoria), and the
aforementioned article describes 3 or 4 banks operating in
[Castlemaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlemaine,_Victoria).

Despite one newspaper’s recommendation to “take a ticket, see the drawing, and
so spend a very entertaining half-hour in a Chinese
lottery-office,”[@SpendAHalfHour] by 1864 lotteries were being raided by police
and the proprietors charged.[@PoliceCourtsAChineseLottery]

The first explicit mention of the game under the name “pak-a-pu” is in 1873,

Bourke Street in Melbourne for running a pak-a-pu
bank.[@TheChineseGamblingHouses] The bank was known as the “No. 6” or “You Lee”
lottery. Picking all ten numbers on a sixpenny ticket would return £75. A
similar case was brought against the “No. 2” or “Shing Lee” lottery in
1874.[@TheChineseLotteryCases] Both banks were reported to carry a capital of
£300, which is also reported elsewhere as the standard amount.

There were perhaps attempts by the banks to make themselves publicly acceptable,
as in 1874 the “Chinese Pak-Cup-Pew Trading Company” made a donation of £100
towards the hospital in Melbourne.[@PakCupPewHospital] 

In any case, despite suppression, the game became very popular in Melbourne: in
1876 it was reported that there were 25 agents operating in the area between
Swanston and Russell streets.[@InAChineseLotteryShop p. 7]

By 1877 the inequality between the prosecution of Chinese and European games was
noted in the papers:

> One of the most humiliating anomalies in our penal code is the law which
> visits fantan and pak-a-pu with fine and imprisonment, and winks complacently
> at the wholesale public gambling of Europeans. With the Chinese, games of
> chance are almost the sole national recreation in this colony, and it seems
> scarcely fair to enforce upon them the rigid and austere virtue which we take
> care never to practice ourselves. On the racecourse, in the stock exchange,
> and in the streets, betting goes on apace, and oftener than not the worldly
> prosperity of a man’s family hangs upon the issue of a wager.[@HumiliatingAnomalies]

However, not everyone agreed. <cite>The Bulletin</cite>{%fn%}<cite>The
Bulletin</cite> was an astoundingly racist publication during this period,
whose motto would soon be “Australia for the White Man”.{%endfn%} claimed the
opposite to be true:

> If an Australian started a fan-tan hell, Darlinghurst{%fn%}i.e. [Darlinghurst

This article was accompanied by what has been called the “most scandalous and
racist cartoon ever to grace the Australian media”,[@RacismRife] depicting “pak
ah pu” as one leg of the “Mongolian octopus”, alongside “immorality”,
“small-pox” and “typhoid”, “opium”, “fan tan”, “bribery”, “cheap labour”, and
“customs robbery”.{%fn%}This cartoon was drawn by [Phil
May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_May_(caricaturist)) and is easy enough

### In New Zealand

As in Australia, racist depictions of Chinese gambling were common. And yet,
while newspaper reports often decried gambling and gamblers, others came to the
defence of the game.

#### Legality and Hypocrisy

records four simultaneous bets on sets of five numbers; the drawn lines divide
the ticket into four separate zones.

{% imageEnd %}

Pakapoo was illegal from 1862 in Otago,[@RememberingChinatown p. 93] and would
 be made illegal nationwide with the passage of the [Gaming and Lotteries Act of
1881](http://nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/gala188145v1881n10273/), where it was
listed alongside Fan-Tan. The addition of the games was made despite the
lawmakers’ lack of knowledge about what the games comprised:

> Our representatives in Parliament seem to have had a good deal of fun over the
> Gaming and Lotteries Bill on Friday night. […] considerable amusement was
> caused by the numerous enquiries of [Colonial Secretary
> Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dick_(politician)) as to the

> word, and after the mover had satisfactorily explained that his knowledge was
> as exhaustive of ‘pakapoo’ as that of the Colonial Secretary of fan-tan, the
> words were added.[@CluthaPolitical]

By 1902 and 1903 there was some legal tussle over the status of the game due to
unclear definitions in the Act.

{%aside%}Upon reading the case summary, I get the impression that the Chief
Justice ([Robert Stout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stout)) must have
been somewhat on the side of the Chinese, or disliked the law in some way. It is
perhaps worth noting his support of liberal causes including women’s suffrage.
Some flavour of the ruling is given in these quotes:<blockquote>The Magistrate,
in his statement of the case, had stated that when the police had gone into the
house, the game of pak-a-pu was being played, whereas the only piece of evidence
they had, that of Detective Cox, showed that when the police entered the house
the men were running away. This was not playing
pak-a-pu.</blockquote>{%endaside%}

Firstly, a case in 1902 concerning one “Joe Quick” (who had been fined several
times for the game previously) reached the Supreme Court, and had its conviction
quashed upon insufficient
evidence.[@WhenDoesAManPlayPakAPu][@ImportantJudgement]

At the time, Wellington’s <cite>Evening Post</cite> opined that:

> … it seems the essence of petty spite to start a crusade against the
> cottager’s Christmas goose or the Chinaman’s pakapoo.[@ThePolicemanAndTheGeese]

[John Liddell Kelly’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Liddell_Kelly)
bitingly sarcastic poem “In China” (1901) contains the following
verse:[@HeatherAndFern p. 56]

> The practice of gambling’s a terrible vice<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;’Mong the sin-sodden people of China!<br/>
> Fan-tan, pak-a-pu, and a species of dice<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;Are all known to the gamblers of China.<br/>
> True, we bet in our streets, and play cards in our pubs;<br/>
> We have poker and nap in our big, toney clubs;<br/>
> But we cannot attend to our own dirty dubs<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;While we’re preaching reform—out in China.

The decision of this case, wherein the Chief Justice mentioned — [<span
lang="la">obiter
dictum</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum) — that pakapoo was
defined by the Act as a “game of chance” and not a lottery,[@JoeQuickVCox] was
to have a lasting effect on other cases. In 1903 a case in the Magistrate’s
Court was dismissed on the basis that pakapoo was a game of chance, and not a
lottery;[@PakAPooNotALottery] taken at face value, the Act stated that games of
chance were only illegal if played in public places.

{% imageEnd %}

With the game seeming to be on the verge of becoming legal, in 1904, the “Gaming
and Lotteries Act Amendment Bill” was introduced to parliament by [James
McGowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McGowan_(politician)). The bill
sought — among other things — to declare pakapoo a lottery, and thus ban it
outright. By the reception of this bill in the newspapers, it is clear that this
was felt to be inconsistent with laws governing games played by Europeans:

> For a country which not only countenances the
> [totalisator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting), but also
> derives revenue from it, it is the height of inconsistency to discriminate
> between different forms of gambling. Why should fan-tan be more wicked than
> bridge, or pakapoo than poker, and why should not both be legalised if it is
> legal to gamble by means of the totalisator?[@InconsistentLegislation]

During parliamentary debate on the proposed bill,

> Mr Hone Heke{%fn%}i.e. [<span class="noun" lang="mi">Hōne Heke
Ngāpua</span>,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dne_Heke_Ng%C4%81pua)
great-nephew of the more famous [<span class="noun" lang="mi">Hōne Heke
Pōkai</span>.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dne_Heke){%endfn%} wanted to
know why the Chinese were to be limited in their games and recreations, when
lotteries at church bazaars were allowed to proceed without interference.
> 
> Mr [W.
> Fraser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fraser_(New_Zealand_politician,_born_1840))
> thought it was right to punish Europeans found in a Chinese gambling house,
> but seeing that Europeans were allowed to participate in various games of
> chance, he objected to punishing Chinese for doing the same
> thing.[@HoneHekePakAPoo]

As noted in that last paragraph, it was often considered that the game was
suitable for Chinese people but not Europeans. [Robin
Hyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hyde), writing later in 1934, noted:

> … the Chinese quarter in most cities suffers from its hangers-on. Auckland’s
> pakapoo dens receive such loving care from the police for much the same
> reason. No harm in a friendly all-Chinese game of fantan and pakapoo — and
> ninety-nine games out of a hundred are ‘on the level’ — but the drawing of the
> tickets induces whites of the very worst class to make the site thereof their
> little home away from home.[@DisputedGround p. 235]

In any case, the proposed bill was subsequently withdrawn and this version of
the amendment was never passed.

</div>

Only a year later, in 1905, the Supreme Court again heard a case regarding
Pak-A-Poo (<cite>Lee Sun v. Daniel Conolly</cite>),[@LeeSunVDanielConolly] and
this time [Justice Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Williams)
determined that not only was Pak-A-Poo a game of chance, but it was *also* a
lottery, and therefore illegal.{%fn%}Apparently Williams and Stout were
pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al rivals — Williams had been passed over when Stout was selected as
Chief Justice — and I am tempted to wonder if this had some part to play in the
overruling of the earlier <span lang="la">obiter dictum</span>.{%endfn%}


Finally, in 1907, the Gaming and Lotteries Act Amendment Act was passed, which
declared *all* games of chance to be explicitly unlawful. The game was to remain
illegal until the passage of a new Gaming and Lotteries Act in 1977.

Even after all gambling was made illegal, protests were made about the inequal
application of the law, and these would continue throughout the twentieth
century; in 1933, one businessman complained about the effect the ban could have
upon trade with China:

> “It is well known,” [Mr. John MacGibbon] said, “that in most homes in New
> Zealand the gambling laws are broken with impunity. This harrying of Chinese
> who play pakapoo and fan tan has an effect on Chinese who are likely to buy

> people in the world, and it should be remembered that we forced opium on them
> because of the profit in it. It is utter hypocrisy.” [@HarryingOfChinese]

### In the United Kingdom


{%aside%}
The @GuinnessMusicFacts [p. 266] states that the “first English
recording of a dance band with vocal refrain” was of a song entitled ‘Puck-a-Pu’, sung by
Ernest Pike with the Mayfair Dance Orchestra, on the 9th of November 1920. The recording can be
heard
[here](http://www.mgthomas.co.uk/Soundfiles/Ragtime/Mayfair%20Dance%20Orch%20-%20Puck-A-Pu.mp3). 
Note that it can best be described as “musical Chinoiserie”, and the lyrics are fairly racist.
{%endaside%}

Pak-a-pu seems to have reached London later than the other locations discussed
here; it doesn’t begin to appear in the newspaper until the early 1920s. Even as
late as 1924 it is described as a “new gambling game”.[@NewGamblingGame1924]

Another example: although Fan-Tan is in several stories in Thomas Burke’s 1917
collection @LimehouseNights — set in Limehouse, London’s main Chinese
community at the time — Pak-a-pu is not, but it does make an appearance in his
1938 short story “The Yellow Box”.

### In South Africa

According to @TheBantuInTheCity [p. 219], four syndicates were operating
throughout the Johannesburg area in 1935. 



## Globalization, or Kenoization

The “Chinese lottery” was to become Europeanized — and therefore, acceptable —
through its adoption and development by American casino operators in the early
20th century. It is probable that the game was adapted in several locations by
Americans looking to popularize it,{%fn%}For example, Eugene Diullo, Harrah’s
first keno manager, learned the game growing up in
[Ely,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ely,_Nevada)[@EveryLightWasOn p. 125] but
this was still at the time the Chinese game.{%endfn%} but what appears to be the
main thread of popularization is recounted here.

Versions of the “Chinese lottery” were played in Butte, Montana. Just like in
the examples above, Butte was a mining town with a significant migrant Chinese
population. The game was played illegally in the backrooms of “cigar stores”,
which also operated as speakeasies. One in particular, the Crown Cigar Store,
was operating the Chinese game in 1927.[@LostButte p. 50] {%fn%}A court case
from 1948 shows that at the Crown the adapted game, using numbers, was at that
time known as “the Crown Game” or the “Crown
[punchboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punchboard)
game”,[@StatevCrownCigarStore] but it was clearly derived from the “Chinese
 lottery”.{%endfn%} The gambling operation was managed by two brothers, Joe and
 Francis Lyden.{%fn%}Some sources give the name as “Frances”. The Lyden
 brothers — Joseph Michael (1899–1982)[@JosephMichaelLyden] and Francis — were
 Irish immigrants who had inherited the store from their
 step-father.[@LydenBrothers]{%endfn%}

THIS IS ALL OUT OF ORDER AND NEEDS REËDITING

New para: despite Keno not being a lottery, even many keno writers believed it
to be a lottery[@AFamilyAffair p. 179] (many other examples).

These Butte games were routinely shut down by the police, but in 1931 Nevada
legalized gambling in [Assembly Bill No.
98](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Statutes/35th1931/Stats193102.html#Stats193102page165)
(popularly known as the “Wide Open Gambling Bill”). The bill explicitly
legalized “keno”, as long as the person running the game had procured a license
to do so.{%fn%}It is worth noting, given the ongoing theme of anti-Chinese
discrimination here, that licenses were only available to US citizens, and
‘aliens’ were not allowed to even operate a licensed game. This seems
particularly egregious given that the distinctly Chinese game of Fan-Tan was
also explicitly legalized by the bill… but only for US citizens!{%endfn%}

At this time, the name “keno” (or “quino”) referred to a Bingo-like game from
the 19th century (see the {%gameref keno-bingo %} article for more). This game
used pre-printed sheets and randomly-drawn numbers, and is not directly related
to the modern game of Keno, where sheets are marked by the players.{%fn%}As
early as 1899, the Chinese game had been referred to as “Chinese Keno” to
distinguish it from the existing Keno game.[@ChineseGamblersRaided]{%endfn%}

However, it seems that the Lyden brothers seized upon this opportunity to
rebrand their game under the “keno” name. In 1935 Francis moved to Reno, where
he began to work for John Petricciani, owner of the newly-opened Palace
Club.[@FrancisLydenButteBoy] {%fn%}Joe Lyden would also later (after 1938?) move
to Las Vegas and start the first Keno game there, at the Fremont.{%endfn%}

### “Chinese Keno”

Earlier attempts to run the Chinese lottery under the “keno” name had failed: in
1932, one Woo Sing, had purchased a Keno license under which to operate the
“Chinese lottery” in the Henry Club, only to have the license revoked by the
Reno city council and his staff arrested.[@LotteryAndKenoContrasted] While the
case against the staff was eventually dropped, Woo Sing was unable to recover
his $300 license fee. In May 1933, one J. B. Crane, an associate of Woo Sing’s,
attempted to procure a license to run the game as “keno”.{%fn%}At the Lucky
Club, 233 Lake Street.{%endfn%} Crane stated (correctly) that the game was not
actually a lottery and hence not illegal, and that his game would use numbers in
place of Chinese characters, and the license was granted.[@CraneIssuedKeno] By
the middle of June the club had been ordered to stop the
game,[@ChineseLotteryOrderedClosed] then permitted to reopen
it,[@ChineseKenoGamesToOperate] until finally Crane’s licenses were revoked and
his club was ordered shut.[@JBCrane]{%fn%}Crane had previously boasted that the
council did not have the power to refuse a license, which must not have helped
his cause.{%endfn%} Another operator named Walter Tun, who had watched the
proceedings closely, also chose to close his “lottery”
operation.[@CouncilRevokesCrane] While all this was going on there seems to have
been something of a turf war between Tun and Sing,[@ChineseDisputeSettlement]
and in July, Woo Sing was shot by an unknown assailant.{%fn%}The case was never
solved, despite a $500 ($11,400 in
2002) reward being offered for information by the Yick Keong Benevolent
Association.{%endfn%} Crane again sought licenses in
July,[@ChineseGamblerIsWounded] and August,[@CouncilAdjournsAndCraneFails] at
which point the petition was referred to a grand jury in
September,[@WashoeCoGrandJury] but I cannot find any further trace of
it.{%fn%}Perhaps the death of Crane’s wife’s father in September brought an end
to his pursuit of the matter.{%endfn%}

A newspaper report of the time shows the confused reaction to Crane’s August
application, as Crane’s lawyer James T. Boyd debated the meaning of “keno” with
City Attorney Pike:[@WeAreRecessed]

> Pike—“Does the license ask for keno? Do they intend to play keno or Chinese
> keno?”
> 
> Boyd—“Try and find a definition for keno?”
> 
> Pike—“I can show you one in Corpus Juris and it does not include the Chinese
> game.”
> 
> Boyd—“Does it include the games played in places on Virginia street. Any time
> you take numbered balls out of—”
>
> Pike—“They call the games on Virginia street tango—I don’t think they’re legal
> either.”{%fn%}Tango (from Spanish <span lang="es">tengo</span>, “I have it”)
> at this time also referred to a version of the Bingo-style Keno
> game.[@YouCantMiss] It had been played since 1931 at the Reno Club on Virginia
> Street,[@OpenTodayRenoClub] and the name was probably influenced by the tango
> (dance) which was popular at the time.{%endfn%}

By July 1934, things seem to have calmed down somewhat, as both Walter Tun and
Woo Sing were simultaneously granted keno licenses, to operate at the Star Club
and Public Club, respectively.[@ChineseGrantedKenoLicenses] Despite one
councillor immediately attempting to revoke these licenses, and the debate
reopening upon “Chinese keno”,[@KenoDiscussionAgainHeard] they were apparently
able to operate unmolested until May 1935, at which point the District Attorney
stepped in and ordered them to shut
down.[@ChineseLotteriesOrderedClosed]{%fn%}Woo Sing would eventually be arrested
on narcotics charges in 1937 and the Public Club closed down.{%endfn%}

Despite these cases, Francis Lyden proposed running a “keno” game, and contacted
Warren Nelson, who he knew from Butte, to run it at the Palace
Club.[@SilvioPetricciani p. 26] At the time Warren was running games in Great
Falls.{%fn%}Warren states his father and a man named Cal Lewis ran the game
together in the Mint Cigar Store, but that he was taught the game by a younger
man named Jimmy Shea after his father refused to teach
him.[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 29]{%endfn%}

Warren had at first run the game in the backroom of the Mint Cigar Store in
Butte. Initially, they had used the same method of drawing the numbers as in the
Chinese version of the game (paper strips rolled and placed in four containers),
but eventually moved on to using balls which were jumbled in a tumbler. The number of
drawings was also increased to a much faster pace of one every fifteen minutes. It
was this version of the game that was taken to the Palace Club in
Nevada.[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 34–5, 50–1]

Thus, the first publicly played version of the Americanized game appears to have
been “Race Horse Keno”, which was launched by the Palace Club in Reno in 1936.
The game was given a horse-racing theme, and the Chinese characters were
replaced by the numbers 1 to 80. Balls with these numbers could then be drawn to
determine the “winning horses”. It is interesting to note that this
inadvertently returned the game to its pigeon-racing roots.

{% imageEnd %}

As a game of chance and not a lottery, the “new” game was legal under Nevada
laws.[@SilvioPetricciani p. 26] Warren describes in his own words how the game
was lifted from the Chinese:[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 30]

> Keno, which was originally a Chinese game, was well known throughout the West.
> Everywhere you’d go, Chinese could be found running illegal keno games. Some
> of them had tried to start games in Butte, but their competition, white
> professional gamblers, would get their games closed up. Then a fellow went in
> partners with a Chinaman, and when he learned everything he could from him, he
> kicked him out. The Chinese were looked down upon so much that you could do
> anything to them and no one would say a word.

Despite divorcing the game from its Chinese origins, the keno “writers” who
marked the tickets still used hair brushes imported from China,[@EveryLightWasOn
p. 129] and the ink was purchased from Chinese
suppliers.[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 50]

 The Bank Club (the

installing Keno games of their own.[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 53] In 1938 Warren
opened the game at the Nevada Club in Lake Tahoe.[@WarrenNelson p. 10]

Warren also recorded some of the patter (or “ballyhoo”) that was used to
announce the game, mimicking the style of a horse racing
commentator:[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 158]

> All right, they’re off and running!<br/>Jockey number 1 on Nanny
> Dee.<br/>Jockey 16 on Mainstreet,<br/>Right down the main drag.<br/>You’ve got

at the Crown Cigar Store in Montana, 1948.[@StatevCrownCigarStore]

{% imageEnd %}

In this “racehorse” version of the game, each number had a horse’s name assigned
to it, and the names were announced in a similar way to the way that “[bingo
calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_bingo_nicknames)” are now
performed. Other examples of names included:[@EveryLightWasOn p. 128]

<div class="columnar">

- 51: Tut-Tut
- 52: Casey
- 54: Minty
- 70: Black Tom

The racehorse version of the game died out some time in the mid
1950s.[@EveryLightWasOn p. 128]
