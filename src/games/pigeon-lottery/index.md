lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Guangdong</span> during the late Qing dynasty, and which in the
19th and 20th centuries was spread throughout countries bordering the Pacific Ocean by
Chinese emigrants.
</p>

The recent history of the game is often a story of racism and hypocrisy: as a
Chinese gambling game, Chinese migrants were punished for running the game while
at the same time gambling games favoured by Europeans were permitted. In the 20th
century the game was adapted by Americans who profited from a now-legal game
even as the Chinese game was suppressed. Eventually the game became known under
the modern name of Keno, which is now played in casinos around the world.

<!-- excerpt -->

In European sources, the game is often referred to as simply “the Chinese
lottery”. The transliteration of the game is usually given as “pak-a-poo” (most
common in New Zealand) or “pak-a(h)-pu” (most common in Australia). In London
(particularly centered around the Chinese community in Pennyfields, Poplar) it
was referred to as “puk-a-pu” or “puk-a-poo”, and in South Africa
“pa-ka-pu”.[@TheBantuInTheCity p. 423] Other variants are
“pak-a-peu”,[@PakAPeuAtLawrence] “puck-a-pu”, “pukka-poo”, or “pac-a-poo”. In
Macau it is given with the Portugeuse romanization of “pacapio”, which remains
standard in current usage (previous terms include <span
lang="pt">p’u-pio</span>[@ACidadeMaisPitoresca]). In the USA it was at first
referred to as “boc hop bu”[@NYTimes18870127] before picking up a variety of the
other names mentioned above, as well as “Bock Ka Pian”,[@WhatTheHeathenPlays]
but in Hawaiʻi it was referred to as “pakapio”.[@Pakapio]

While the specifics vary, the play of the game is simple: each player purchases
one or more tickets upon which they mark some set of characters out of the
eighty that are printed on the ticket. The seller or “bank” then randomly
selects a given number of characters, and players win money according to the
number of matching characters they have marked on their ticket. The specific
numbers of characters chosen and the permissible bets vary by both time and
location.

In many locations the game was treated as illegal, running afoul of anti-lottery
laws; this despite it not being a lottery.{%fn%}See, for example,
@GamblingGamesOfMalaya [p. 48]: “although this form of gambling is named in the
Chinese as ‘Lottery’, there is doubt that it is in fact a ‘lottery’. In a
lottery there is a distribution of prices (usually money) by chance or lot. But
in this form of gambling there are no prizes in the accepted sense, and although
money paid out by a promoter to lucky punters is dependant on numbers drawn by
chance, that money is not a distribution of prize money, but is in fulfulment of
betting contracts.”{%endfn%} Even when it started to become popular in American
casinos, many Keno writers (ticket markers) believed it to be a lottery, and
that it had only become quasi-legal through subterfuge (for example, see
@AFamilyAffair [p. 179], and many other examples stating it to be a lottery).

## Early origins

It is sometimes fancifully claimed that the name of the game is due the the
method of ticket selection, in that supposedly originally white pigeons were
used to choose winning tickets, but that is not possible given the way the game
is played; it is *not* a lottery where one or more tickets are selected to be
winners.

One Chinese origin story says that the name is because white pigeons were used
to transmit the results from gambling houses to the
bettors.[@GrammarOfTheChineseLanguage2 p. 157] Another dates the game to the
foundation of the Han dynasty, saying that it was invented by [<span
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin" class="noun">Zhāng
Liáng</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Liang_(Western_Han)) (<span
lang="zh">張良</span>, <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr>&nbsp;251–189
{%bce%}),{%fn%}Older sources transliterate his name as Cheung Leung.{%endfn%}
advisor to [Emperor <span class="noun"
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Gāozǔ</span>,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozu_of_Han)
in order to raise money for the support of the army when a city was
beseiged.[@GrammarOfTheChineseLanguage2 p. 156] While <span
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin" class="noun">Zhāng Liáng</span> may have really used a
lottery to raise funds, it seems to be unlikely to be identical to the modern
game. For one thing, the <cite>Thousand Character Classic</cite> upon which the
game is based is traditionally dated to the [Liang
dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_dynasty) (502–557 {%ce%}).

The true origin of the game apparently lies in gambling that was carried out as part of 
the early-Qing “white pigeon festival” (<span lang="zh-Hant">白鴿會</span> Cantonese: <span
lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">baak6 gap3 wui2</span>) which was held in Guangdong.
Pigeons were raced from [Qingyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingyuan)
(<span lang="zh">清遠</span>) to [Foshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foshan)
(<span lang="zh">佛山</span>), and groups of pigeons were numbered using the
opening characters from the [<cite>Thousand Character
Classic</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Character_Classic) (<span
lang="zh">千字文</span>).{%fn%}This system of enumeration has also been used to
number volumes of books and other objects, including in the instructions for
assembly kit-set furniture.[@RepresentingHainingStreet1 p. 53]{%endfn%} Bets
were made on which group of pigeons would return intact.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 84]
Eventually the pigeons were dropped entirely and a game was developed based on
characters begin drawn at random.


## Known history

According to the [<cite>Draft History of <span class="noun"
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Qing</span></cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_History_of_Qing),[@QinYingChapter]
the official <span class="noun" lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Qin Ying</span> (<span lang="zh">秦瀛</span>,
1743–1821) banned pigeon tickets in Guangdong in the “ninth year of [<span class="noun"
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Jiaqing</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaqing_Emperor)”
(1804/5), so the game must have existed at this point.[@SparrowAndPigeon]

In 1849, a traveller from Yunnan province visited Guangdong and reported that:

> In the western part of the provincial capital Guangzhou, people in Henan area
> developed cunning ways to operate the “white pigeon” lottery. Even women and
> children were addicted to the game. The former governor of Guangdong
> considered the “white pigeon” lottery to have been going out of control so he
> prohibited it. When this governor got promoted and left, the trend of playing
> the lottery came back.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 64]

In the late 19th century, the game was also known as <span
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Xiǎowéixìng</span> <span lang="zh">小闈姓</span> ‘small
surname guessing lottery’,[@BettingOnEmpire p. 85] after the main <span
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Wéixìng</span> <span lang="zh">闈姓</span> ‘surname
guessing lottery’, which was based upon guessing the surnames of people who
passed the [imperial service
examinations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination)

<!--
Li Hongzhang (<span lang="zh">李鴻章</span>), governor-general of Guangdong, and
his successor Deshou (<span lang="zh">德壽</span>), made legal all forms of
gambling under license from 1899–1903, but this was reversed by subsequent
governor-general Cen Chunxuan (<span lang="zh">岑春煊</span>).[@BettingOnEmpire

GT translation:

Although the second text above makes the numbering format of racing pigeons more specific and is the same as the numbering format of "White Pigeon Tickets" in "Thousand Characters", it further exposes the theory that it is a fiction attached to later generations. This is because it does not cite any evidence of the provenance, and the undocumented pigeon numbering system originated in the late Qing Dynasty, obviously much later than the "white pigeon ticket" that appeared before the middle of the Qing Dynasty. According to Zhao Lifeng from "Drafts of Qing History. According to the textual research of Qin Ying Biography: "In the ninth year of Jiaqing, Qin Ying banned white pigeon tickets in Guangdong", "it seems to be presumed that the white pigeon tickets were produced during the Qianlong period". (22) Therefore, the second article cited above can also be judged as a purely contrived misrepresentation. Although such articles are conclusive and well-founded on the surface, they are in fact unfounded claims. Therefore, the "white pigeon ticket" being edited by "Wikipedia" indicates that the source of this source is yet to be found, and its text is as follows:

… later part

In fact, according to the description of "Qin Ying banned white pigeon tickets in Guangdong in the ninth year of Jiaqing", which was verified by Zhao Lifeng, it can be inferred that in the ninth year of Jiaqing (February 11, 1804 - January 30, 1805), there were already white pigeons in Guangdong. The pigeon ticket was passed down from Macau. This is because in fact, during the Qianjia period, government officials at all levels, including Guangdong Province, Guangzhou Prefecture, Xiangshan County, etc., had repeatedly ordered Macau's Portuguese leader "Yimu" to prohibit the "gambling incidents" of Chinese and foreign residents in Macau. (42) Although the relevant materials do not clearly mention the way of “gathering”, the author believes that these “gaming events” should be the Western lottery introduced by Portugal and the Chinese lottery inspired by the Chinese. That is caused by the white pigeon ticket. For example, on the seventh day of the third lunar month in the tenth year of Jiaqing (April 6, 1805), Peng Zhaolin, the magistrate of Xiangshan, once investigated the "event of opening bids and gathering gambling by Tibetan merchants", and issued a notice saying: "If people gather to open bids, People who are tempted to invest in silver to buy bids are prohibited from doing so. […] If you dare to disobey and do not comply, and there are still people gathering to open bids, the county will visit the real case, and it will definitely be investigated and dealt with strictly in accordance with Daxian. (43) From the text of the ban, it can be inferred that the “Fan merchants opening bids and gathering gambling incident” had already happened, and was only known by the magistrate far away in Xiangshan County and ordered the ban. Since the lottery issued by the Hall of Mercy began in 1810, it is not Lottery of the Hall of Mercy. The "bid" of "bid opening" and "buying bid" mentioned in the article should be the abbreviation of "white dove label (ticket)". The Portuguese name of the Macau Government Gazette on the 22nd is “Lotaria de China”, which means “Chinese lottery”.(44) It can be seen that the “white pigeon label (ticket)” is a product of Portuguese lottery principles and then transformed by Chinese methods. , so it is called "Chinese lottery" or "Chinese lottery". Moreover, pigeons are mostly gray, brown, white, etc. are a few, and pigeons are generally referred to as "white pigeons", which is a unique phenomenon in Cantonese and Cantonese. It is called "鹁ge" as a result of the transliteration.(45) And the pronunciation of "Piao" as "Biao" is also a phenomenon still preserved in Cantonese dialects. “Bid (ticket)”, and winning the betting ticket is “Zhongma Biao (ticket)”. It is enough to prove that “White Pigeon Bid (ticket)”, a “Chinese lottery” or “Chinese lottery” originated from Portuguese lottery and originated in Guangdong and Macau The lottery was created and officially named by the Cantonese.

This is because although these articles are all well documented and apparently justifiable, they are in fact untraceable and assumed. Therefore, Wikipedia is editing the "pigeon ticket" note to find the origin of this source, the text is as follows.

… much later:

    In fact, according to Zhao Lifeng's testimony that "Qin Ying banned white pigeon tickets in Guangdong in the ninth year of Jiaqing", it can be assumed that white pigeon tickets existed in Guangdong in the ninth year of Jiaqing (February 11, 1804-January 30, 1805) and were transmitted from Macao. This is because, in fact, during the Qian-Jia period, Chinese officials at various levels of government in Guangdong Province, Guangzhou Prefecture, and Xiangshan County repeatedly ordered the Portuguese chiefs of Macau, the "yi mu", to prohibit "gambling events" among the Chinese and foreign residents of Macau. (42) Although the information does not explicitly mention the name of the "gambling events", the author, after a comprehensive study, believes that these "gambling events" were caused by the introduction of the Western lottery from Portugal and the Chinese lottery, or pigeon tickets, which were inspired by the Chinese. For example, on the seventh day of the third month of the tenth year of Jiaqing (April 6, 1805), Peng Zhaolin, the governor of Xiangshan, investigated "the incident of the gambling of the foreign merchants by opening bids," issuing a circular saying: "If the people are confused to buy the bids by opening bids, they are forbidden to do so. [If you do not comply with the law, or if you still have a case of crowded bidding, the county will visit the case and report it to the Grand Constabulary for investigation and serious punishment." (43) From the text of this prohibition, it can be inferred that "the incident of the lottery of a foreign merchant" had already occurred and was prohibited by order of the county magistrate who was far away from Xiangshan County. Since the lottery was first issued in 1810, it is clear that this was not a lottery for Ren Ci Tang. The "bid" mentioned in the article for "opening" and "buying" is an abbreviation of "white pigeon bid (ticket)". The name of the "Pigeon Ticket" in the Macao Government Gazette of May 22, 1872 is "Lotaria de China", which means "Chinese Lottery". (44) It can be seen that the "Lotaria de China" is a Chinese lottery. (44) It can be seen that the "white pigeon (ticket)" is a product of the Portuguese lottery principle and then modified in the Chinese way, so it is called "Chinese lottery" or "Chinese lottery". Moreover, pigeons are mostly gray, with brown and white being the minority. The common name for pigeons as "white pigeons" is unique to Cantonese, and is the result of a phonetic change from the ancient name for pigeons, "卧式鴿". (45) The pronunciation or writing of "ticket" as "biao" is also a phenomenon still retained in the Cantonese dialect. For example, in Hong Kong, the Cantonese language still refers to "horse tickets" as "馬標 (ticket)" and "winning horse tickets" as "中馬標 (ticket)". This proves that the "Chinese lottery" or "Chinese lottery", which originated from the Portuguese lottery and was created in Macau, Guangdong, was created and officially named by the Cantonese.

What is known for certain is that it was first legalized in Macau by [<span class="noun"
lang="pt">João Maria Ferreira do
Amaral</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Maria_Ferreira_do_Amaral)
(1803–1849), who authorized the game in January 1847 upon the request of local
Chinese businessmen.[@GamesOfChanceInMacau2 p. 110] Macau had been declared a
free port in 1845, hoping to increase trade and business under competition from
the recently-established British colony at Hong Kong (1842). Despite this, Macau
was still in decline and Amaral was under pressure to raise revenue. Attempts by
Amaral to introduce new taxes were unpopular and had even led to [an armed
revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_of_the_Faiti%C3%B5es) in October
1846. Thus, a system was devised whereby monopoly rights for important goods
(including pork and beef, fish, salt, oysters and opium) were sold or auctioned
off.  Gambling monopolies were a logical extension of this idea. 

The Macau Senate were unhappy with a number of the decisions made by the
governor, and complained directly to Lisbon that, among other things, 

> … the Chinese were given license to operate lotteries inside the city, a thing
> that the same Government which allowed it had just two months before forbidden
> as immoral and harmful to peacefulness and public tranquility.[@GamesOfChanceInMacau2 p. 110]

Nevertheless, the game was permitted to continue and licenses to run <span
lang="pt">pacapio</span> began to be issued on an annual basis from April 5,
1848. The game is still played today in Macau, but it is not very
popular.{%fn%}A study in 2019 found that only 4 out of 855 gamblers (0.5%)
had played the game in the last 12 months.[@SegmentingChineseGamblers]{%endfn%}

## The Game

The primary artifact of the game is the *ticket*, a slip of paper upon which is
printed the name of the bank (see below) and 80 unique Chinese characters. These
characters are the first 80 taken from the [<cite>Thousand Character
Classic</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Character_Classic) (<span
lang="zh">千字文</span>), and are always printed in a top-down, right-to-left
order, broken into four-character blocks:

<blockquote lang="zh" class="vertical-rl mx-auto blockquote">

</blockquote>

A striking thing about this layout is just how consistent it was across all
countries where the game was played. A ticket as used in Nevada was almost identical
to one used in Victoria (Australia) or Otago (New Zealand). Tickets were printed
locally,{%fn%}The National Library of New Zealand has [at least 10 pakapoo
printing blocks](https://tiaki.natlib.govt.nz/#details=ecatalogue.470454), and
another photo [documents the movement of a printing
press](https://tiaki.natlib.govt.nz/#details=ecatalogue.949016) that was
originally used by one Joe Quinn to print pakapoo tickets in
Wellington.{%endfn%} as well as exported from China to other
countries.{%fn%}See, for example, [this
ticket](https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/chinesecanadianstories/gri/items/1.0367497)
which is explicitly printed “Made in China”. [Other
tickets](https://oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb3j49n63p/?docId=hb3j49n63p&order=7&brand=oac4&layout=printable-details)
show evidence that the bank name was stamped onto the ticket at some stage later
than the character grid was printed. Stewart Culin also describes how tickets
were shipped from China in “large quantities”.[@ChineseInAmerica p. 7]{%endfn%}
Tickets often bore the phrase <span lang="zh">照來原底給</span> “printed
according to the original”, so fidelity to the ideal form of the ticket was
apparently sought-after.

meaning “an expert in making money”, a reference to an extract from the
Confucian [<cite>Book of
Rites</cite>.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Rites)
{%imageEnd%}

The place that distributed the winnings and collected the profits was invariably
referred to as the “bank”, and each bank would have its own name. In places such
as California, where [<span
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">tongs</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_(organization))
(<span lang="zh">堂</span>) were established, the banks would often be tied to a
particular <span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">tong</span>.[@EncyclopediaOfKeno p. 8]
Guidebooks such as [<cite>Essentials of the
Lottery</cite>](http://oac-upstream.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb5x0nb117/?order=3&brand=oac4)
(<cite lang="zh">票圖撮要</cite>, 1894) were also published, which instructed
prospective bank owners how to calculate payouts for various forms of tickets.

To play the game, a player would take a blank ticket, mark ten characters of
their choosing, and then register their ticket with the bank. The bank would
make a copy of the player’s ticket to ensure the security of the draw. Later, at
a specified time, twenty numbers would be drawn, and any registered tickets with
at least five matching characters be paid out at their specified rates (for
which, see below).

There were different methods for selecting the winning numbers. The drawing of
numbers was performed publicly to assure bettors that the game was fair. A
Sydney newspaper report of a court case from 1886 gives the following
method:{%fn%}The same method is described in Melbourne in
1876.[@InAChineseLotteryShop p. 7]{%endfn%} 80 pieces of paper with one
character each were rolled up and then mixed in a jar. From this jar, the pieces
of paper were divided into four bowls, giving 20 tickets per bowl. Next, four
pieces of wood engraved with a character each and then wrapped in paper (to hide
the characters) were randomly placed, one in each bowl. Four pieces of paper
with matching characters were rolled up and presented to an onlooker, who
selected one, and then the wooden pieces were unwrapped to reveal their
characters and find the matching bowl. The 20 winning numbers from this bowl
were then read out.[@ChineseGamblingInSydney]

The area where the tickets were to be drawn, and where the bank’s capital was
kept, was usually separated from onlookers by wooden bars. European descriptions
and depictions often mention or show long knives that were kept behind the bars
to defend against any attempts upon the bank’s chest (see, e.g. the image on the
right below).

<div class="multi extra-wide">

{% image src="drawing_tickets.jpg" alt="A line drawing of a crowd of people, mostly in European dress, gathered outside the bars of a bank. Inside the bank one Chinese man is writing down characters as they are read out. The Chinese characters are depicted very poorly."

</div>

In some Chinese versions of the game, there were restrictions imposed upon which
characters could be drawn: ten had to be chosen from each of the upper and lower
halves of the tickets, the whole four characters in a particular line, or four
in a block or diagonal could not be selected at once (it is not stated how these
restrictions were enforced).[@BettingOnEmpire p. 104] These rules would allow
the players to feel like they were able to have more control by making informed
selections of characters.

Another feature that was sometimes used that allowed players to feel like they
had some control over the game was the book called the “character container” (<span lang="zh">字容</span>),
which recorded the number of times each character had been drawn in the recent past.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 102]
In reality, this would function similarly to a {% gameref roulette %} tote board which
displays the most recent results, and thus play up the effect of the gambler’s fallacy on the players.

The trend over time has been to increase the payouts on the higher end, which
makes the game more attractive to players while not unduly affecting the house
margin — as long as the house has sufficient capital to avoid going bankrupt
when a player hits a big win. Aggregate payout limits are also used to prevent
such an occurrence; for example, a casino might advertise a $50,000 limit, which
is the maximum combined winnings that players can win on any single game (bigger
winners being paid out first).

## Spread to other countries

The game traveled everywhere that Chinese people migrated to. In particular, it
seems to have been popular in places with goldfields where Chinese men came to
work in the late 19th century: San Francisco in the USA, British Columbia in
Canada, Victoria in Australia, and Otago in New Zealand.

Despite the existence of other very similar games in China, such as the
‘mountain lottery’ (<span lang="zh">山票</span> Mandarin: <span
lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shān piào</span>, Cantonese: <span
lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">saan1 piu3</span>), the pigeon lottery was the only one
that was successfully popularized amongst Europeans.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 193]
Conversely, in countries such as Malaya, where the game was legal during the
[Japanese
occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Malaya)
(1941–42), the pigeon lottery was apparently never as popular as Chee Fah or
Chee Tam (games based upon selecting one out of 36 or 80 characters,
respectively).[@GamblingGamesOfMalaya p. 48]

### In the United States

{%imageEnd%}

According to @EncyclopediaOfKeno, the game was introduced to the Western United
States in the mid-19th century, and had reached the Eastern cities by 1870. 

Mentions of “Chinese lotteries” begin to appear in Californian newspapers from
the 1860s, and sometime around 1863 Mark Twain mentioned the game in a report
for Nevada’s <cite>Territorial Enterprise</cite>, noting its popularity in that
“about every third Chinaman runs a lottery”, and that “we could not see that
these lotteries differed in any respect from our own… the manner of drawing is
similar to ours”.[@RoughingIt p. 396]

The view that many Chinese immigrants were involved in lotteries was not only
one coloured by European eyes; [<span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin" class="noun">Liang
Qichao</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_Qichao) (<span lang="zh">梁啟
超</span>, 1873–1929), who visited Canada and the United States between 1899 and
1903, claimed that almost every Chinese family was involved with gambling in
some way.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 191]

According to Stewart Culin[@ChineseInAmerica p. 11], by 1886 four banks were
operating in Philadelphia{%fn%}He provides the names “Extensive Increase” (<span
lang="yue">廣泰</span> <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">gwong2 taai3</span>), “Heavenly
Harmony” (<span lang="yue">天和</span> <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">tin1 wo4</span>),
“Fortunate Increase” (<span lang="yue">福泰</span> <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">fuk1
taai3</span>), and “Encouraging Fountain” (<span lang="yue">釗泉</span> <span
lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">ciu1 cyun4</span>).{%endfn%} and five in New York, along with
others in Boston and Chicago.

There were ten Chinese lottery banks operating in San Francisco in
1890,[@FoolsOfFortuneOrGamblingAndGamblers p. 450] and by 1892 the same number
operating in New York.[@FanTanGamesToReopen] In 1893 a report from the San
Francisco Chief of Police stated that the police had in their possession 22 tons
of blank lottery tickets which had been confiscated during the previous 13
years;[@SFMunicipal1893 p. 150] by 1898 this had risen to 26
tons.[@SFMunicipal1898 p. 173]{%fn%}The police were occasionally (and
unsuccessfully) sued for the repossession of these tickets.{%endfn%}

By the time <span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin" class="noun">Liang Qichao</span> visited the United
States in 1903, he estimated that one in ten of the Chinese immigrants in the
large cities worked in gambling houses.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 191]

### In Australia

Chinese lotteries are first discussed in Australian newspapers in the 1860s;
pak-a-pu is clearly described in one article of 1863.[@TheChineseLottery1863]
The game seems to have first appeared in the [goldfields of
Victoria,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfields_region_of_Victoria) and the
aforementioned article describes three or four banks operating in
[Castlemaine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlemaine,_Victoria)

Despite one newspaper’s recommendation to “take a ticket, see the drawing, and
so spend a very entertaining half-hour in a Chinese
lottery-office,”[@SpendAHalfHour] by 1864 lotteries were being raided by police
and the proprietors charged.[@PoliceCourtsAChineseLottery]

The first explicit mention of the game that I have found under the name
“pak-a-pu” is in 1873, when a case was brought against the proprietors of the
Heng Hi store on Little Bourke Street in Melbourne for running a pak-a-pu
bank.[@TheChineseGamblingHouses] The bank was known as the “No. 6” or “You Lee”
lottery. Picking all ten numbers on a sixpenny ticket would return £75. A
similar case was brought against the “No. 2” or “Shing Lee” lottery in
1874.[@TheChineseLotteryCases] Both banks were reported to carry a capital of
£300, which is also reported elsewhere as the standard amount carried (and
usually limited the maximum payouts).

There were perhaps attempts by the banks to make themselves publicly acceptable,
as in 1874 the “Chinese Pak-Cup-Pew Trading Company” made a donation of £100
towards the hospital in Melbourne.[@PakCupPewHospital] 

In any case, despite suppression, the game became very popular in Melbourne: in
1876 it was reported that there were 25 agents operating in the area between
Swanston and Russell streets.[@InAChineseLotteryShop p. 7]

By 1877 the inequality between the prosecution of Chinese and European games was
noted in the papers:

> One of the most humiliating anomalies in our penal code is the law which
> visits fantan and pak-a-pu with fine and imprisonment, and winks complacently
> at the wholesale public gambling of Europeans. With the Chinese, games of
> chance are almost the sole national recreation in this colony, and it seems
> scarcely fair to enforce upon them the rigid and austere virtue which we take
> care never to practice ourselves. On the racecourse, in the stock exchange,
> and in the streets, betting goes on apace, and oftener than not the worldly
> prosperity of a man’s family hangs upon the issue of a wager.[@HumiliatingAnomalies]

However, not everyone agreed. <cite>The Bulletin</cite>{%fn%}<cite>The
Bulletin</cite> was an astoundingly racist publication during this period,
whose motto would soon be “Australia for the White Man”.{%endfn%} claimed the
opposite to be true:

> If an Australian started a fan-tan hell, Darlinghurst{%fn%}i.e. [Darlinghurst
> Gaol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlinghurst_Gaol){%endfn%} would be his home, and
> stone-breaking his employment, within a month; and indulgence in pak-ah-pu
> lottery would similarly mean penal seclusion for a lengthy period. But no such
> just retribution overtakes the Mongolian.[@TheChineseInAustraliaBulletin]

This article was accompanied by what has been called the “most scandalous and
racist cartoon ever to grace the Australian media”,[@RacismRife] depicting “pak
ah pu” as one leg of the “Mongolian octopus”, alongside “immorality”,
“small-pox” and “typhoid”, “opium”, “fan tan”, “bribery”, “cheap labour”, and
“customs robbery”.{%fn%}This cartoon was drawn by [Phil
May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_May_(caricaturist)) and is easy enough
to find online.{%endfn%}

### In New Zealand

As in Australia, racist depictions of Chinese gambling were common. And yet,
while newspaper reports often decried gambling and gamblers, others came to the
defence of the game. Here I focus more heavily on the counter-current, as it is
all too easy to find examples of the former.

#### Legality and Hypocrisy

{% image src="pakapoo_ticket.jpg" alt="A ticket with crosses marking chosen characters. There are three lines dividing the ticket into four sections."

{% imageEnd %}

Pakapoo was illegal from 1862 in Otago,[@RememberingChinatown p. 93] and would
 be made illegal nationwide with the passage of the [Gaming and Lotteries Act of
1881](http://nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/gala188145v1881n10273/), where it was
listed alongside Fan-Tan. The addition of the games was made despite the
lawmakers’ lack of knowledge about what the games actually were:

> Our representatives in Parliament seem to have had a good deal of fun over the
> Gaming and Lotteries Bill on Friday night. […] considerable amusement was
> caused by the numerous enquiries of [Colonial Secretary
> Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dick_(politician)) as to the
> meaning of the Chinese game of ‘fan-tan’. One after another of the members

> he shortly rose, and with signs of conscious ignorance, yet inward
> satisfaction, protested that he really did not know anything about it. Then
> numerous questions were asked as to who did know, and other members rose, and
> each gave delightfully varied descriptions, each member beseeching the
> Committee not to let words pass of which they did not know the meaning, as
> they might play ‘fan-tan’ without knowing it, which, in the light of
> subsequent and apparently authoritative explanation, seemed quite possible,
> seeing that it is simply termed ‘odd or even.’ [Mr
> Barron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barron_(politician)) increased
> the dilemma by moving that ‘pakapoo’ be inserted after ‘fan-tan’. The Colonial
> Secretary intimated that he did not know its meaning, but thought it a good
> word, and after the mover had satisfactorily explained that his knowledge was
> as exhaustive of ‘pakapoo’ as that of the Colonial Secretary of fan-tan, the
> words were added.[@CluthaPolitical]

By 1902 and 1903 there was some legal tussle over the status of the game due to
unclear definitions in the Act.

{%aside%}Upon reading the case summary, I get the impression that the Chief
Justice ([Robert Stout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stout)) must have
been somewhat on the side of the Chinese, or disliked the law in some way. It is
perhaps worth noting his support of liberal causes including women’s suffrage.
Some flavour of the ruling is given in these quotes:<blockquote>The Magistrate,
in his statement of the case, had stated that when the police had gone into the
house, the game of pak-a-pu was being played, whereas the only piece of evidence
they had, that of Detective Cox, showed that when the police entered the house
the men were running away. This was not playing
pak-a-pu.</blockquote>{%endaside%}

Firstly, a case in 1902 concerning one “Joe Quick” (who had been fined several
times for the game previously) reached the Supreme Court, and had its conviction
quashed upon insufficient
evidence.[@WhenDoesAManPlayPakAPu][@ImportantJudgement]

At the time, Wellington’s <cite>Evening Post</cite> opined that:

> … it seems the essence of petty spite to start a crusade against the
> cottager’s Christmas goose or the Chinaman’s pakapoo.[@ThePolicemanAndTheGeese]

[John Liddell Kelly’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Liddell_Kelly)
bitingly sarcastic poem “In China” (1901) contains the following
verse upon the topic:[@HeatherAndFern p. 56]

> The practice of gambling’s a terrible vice<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;’Mong the sin-sodden people of China!<br/>
> Fan-tan, pak-a-pu, and a species of dice<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;Are all known to the gamblers of China.<br/>
> True, we bet in our streets, and play cards in our pubs;<br/>
> We have poker and nap in our big, toney clubs;<br/>
> But we cannot attend to our own dirty dubs<br/>
> &emsp;&emsp;While we’re preaching reform—out in China.

The decision of this case, wherein the Chief Justice mentioned — [<span
lang="la">obiter
dictum</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obiter_dictum) — that pakapoo was
defined by the Act as a “game of chance” and not a lottery,[@JoeQuickVCox] was
to have a lasting effect on other cases. In 1903 a case in the Magistrate’s
Court was dismissed on the basis that pakapoo was a game of chance, and not a
lottery;[@PakAPooNotALottery] taken at face value, the Act stated that games of
chance were only illegal if played in public places.

{% image src="southern_bank.jpg" alt="Two Chinese men sitting at a counter in fashionable European suits. The name ‘Southern Bank’ and a rough sketch of a British flag are painted on the door. There are pak-a-poo tickets on the counter. The door reads 'Southern Bank'."

{% imageEnd %}

With the game seeming to be on the verge of becoming legal, in 1904, the “Gaming
and Lotteries Act Amendment Bill” was introduced to parliament by [James
McGowan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McGowan_(politician)) The bill
sought — among other things — to declare pakapoo a lottery, and thus ban it
outright. By the reception of this bill in the newspapers, it is clear that this
was felt to be inconsistent with laws governing games played by Europeans:

> For a country which not only countenances the
> [totalisator,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting) but also
> derives revenue from it, it is the height of inconsistency to discriminate
> between different forms of gambling. Why should fan-tan be more wicked than
> bridge, or pakapoo than poker, and why should not both be legalised if it is
> legal to gamble by means of the totalisator?[@InconsistentLegislation]

During parliamentary debate on the proposed bill,

> Mr Hone Heke{%fn%}i.e. [<span class="noun" lang="mi">Hōne Heke
Ngāpua</span>,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dne_Heke_Ng%C4%81pua)
great-nephew of the more famous [<span class="noun" lang="mi">Hōne Heke
Pōkai</span>.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Dne_Heke){%endfn%} wanted to
know why the Chinese were to be limited in their games and recreations, when
lotteries at church bazaars were allowed to proceed without interference.
> 
> Mr [W.
> Fraser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fraser_(New_Zealand_politician,_born_1840))
> thought it was right to punish Europeans found in a Chinese gambling house,
> but seeing that Europeans were allowed to participate in various games of
> chance, he objected to punishing Chinese for doing the same
> thing.[@HoneHekePakAPoo]

As noted in that last paragraph, it was often considered that the game was
suitable for Chinese people but not Europeans. [Robin
Hyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hyde), writing later in 1934, noted:

> … the Chinese quarter in most cities suffers from its hangers-on. Auckland’s
> pakapoo dens receive such loving care from the police for much the same
> reason. No harm in a friendly all-Chinese game of fantan and pakapoo — and
> ninety-nine games out of a hundred are ‘on the level’ — but the drawing of the
> tickets induces whites of the very worst class to make the site thereof their
> little home away from home.[@DisputedGround p. 235]

At one point it was even suggested by a police inspector that only Europeans
should be fined for playing pakapoo, and that “it would be as hard to stop such
recreation amongst the Chinese as to stop whist and other games amongst
Europeans.”[@GamblingAmongChinese]

In any case, McGowan’s 1904 bill was subsequently withdrawn and this version of
the amendment was never passed.

By 1906 the appetite had increased for regulation of all forms of gambling.
{%imageEnd%}

</div>

Only a year later, in 1905, the Supreme Court again heard a case regarding
Pak-A-Poo (<cite>Lee Sun v. Daniel Conolly</cite>),[@LeeSunVDanielConolly] and
this time [Justice Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Williams)
determined that not only was Pak-A-Poo a game of chance, but it was *also* a
lottery, and therefore illegal.{%fn%}Apparently Williams and Stout were
pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al rivals — Williams had been passed over when Stout was selected as
Chief Justice — and I am tempted to wonder if this had some part to play in the
overruling of the earlier <span lang="la">obiter dictum</span>.{%endfn%}


Finally, in 1907, the Gaming and Lotteries Act Amendment Act was passed, which
declared *all* games of chance to be explicitly unlawful. The game was to remain
illegal until the passage of a new Gaming and Lotteries Act in 1977.

Even after all gambling was made illegal, protests were made about the inequal
application of the law, and these would continue throughout the twentieth
century; in 1933, one businessman complained about the effect the ban could have
upon trade with China:

> “It is well known,” [Mr. John MacGibbon] said, “that in most homes in New
> Zealand the gambling laws are broken with impunity. This harrying of Chinese
> who play pakapoo and fan tan has an effect on Chinese who are likely to buy

Pakapoo tickets discovered during the demolition of a house on Wellington’s
Haining Street, May 1960.

Haining Street was the centre of Wellington’s Chinese community and had also
been the centre of pakapoo activity: of the 53 buildings that existed on the street, 20 of
them were used for pakapoo at some stage or another.[@RepresentingHainingStreet2 pp. 94–135]

{%imageEnd%}

Now that we are able to look back with the benefit of time and more sources, it
is clear that, despite lurid newspaper and magazine reports of pakapoo dens and
the supposed conditions thereof, the pakapoo shops functioned not only as a
gambling house but as a meeting-place with a convivial atmosphere, providing a
safe ‘third place’ for Chinese (men, at least) to gather, catch up on news from
home, drink tea, and eat.[@RepresentingHainingStreet1 p. 52, 62] Interviews with
ex-police officers indicate that they thought it a “clean and well-run game”,
and only raided the game when specific complaints had been
made.[@RepresentingHainingStreet1 p. 59]

During the remainder of the 20th century, pakapoo slowly dropped out of the public
eye. I am not aware of any current use of the game — although it is now legal.
Despite this disappearance, it was to have ongoing influence upon New Zealand:
[Allan Highet,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Highet) who was responsible
for early attempts to introduce Lotto as a government minister, had gained his
appetite for gambling by purchasing pakapoo tickets in Haining Street during the
1930s.[@OnARoll p. 247]

### In the United Kingdom


{%aside%}
The @GuinnessMusicFacts [p. 266] states that the “first English
recording of a dance band with vocal refrain” was of a song entitled ‘Puck-a-Pu’, sung by
Ernest Pike with the Mayfair Dance Orchestra, on the 9th of November 1920. The recording can be
heard
[here](http://www.mgthomas.co.uk/Soundfiles/Ragtime/Mayfair%20Dance%20Orch%20-%20Puck-A-Pu.mp3). 
Note that it can best be described as “musical Chinoiserie”, and the lyrics are fairly racist.
{%endaside%}

Pak-a-pu seems to have reached London later than the other locations discussed
here; it doesn’t begin to appear in the newspaper until the early 1920s. Even as
late as 1924 it is described as a “new gambling game”.[@NewGamblingGame1924]

More evidence for this is that, although Fan-Tan is a feature of several stories
in Thomas Burke’s 1917 collection @LimehouseNights — set in Limehouse, London’s
main Chinese community at the time — Pak-a-pu is not, but it does make an
appearance in his short story “The Yellow Box” which was first published in 1938.

### In South Africa

According to @TheBantuInTheCity [p. 219], four syndicates were operating
throughout the Johannesburg area in 1935. 

### In Canada

Visiting in 1899, <span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin" class="noun">Liang Qichao</span> stated that
there were more than 15 pigeon lotteries operating in Vancouver.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 191]

## Globalization, or Kenoization

The “Chinese lottery” was to become Europeanized — and therefore, acceptable —
through its adoption and development by American casino operators in the early
20th century. It is probable that there were many such attempts to adapt the game by
both Chinese and Americans looking to popularize it,{%fn%}For example, Eugene
Diullo, Harrah’s first keno manager, learned the game growing up in the mining town of
[Ely,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ely,_Nevada)[@EveryLightWasOn p. 125] but
this was still at the time the Chinese game.{%endfn%} but here I recount what
appears to be the main thread of popularization which led to widespread
commercial implementation of Keno.

{%image src="americanized_ticket.jpg" alt="A Chinese lottery ticket with a Chinese title but numbers in place of characters."

Evidence of Chinese attempts at popularizing the game include tickets
with numerals written in place of Chinese characters.

{%imageEnd%}

In the early 20th century, versions of the “Chinese lottery” were being played
in Butte, Montana. Just like the examples above of other locations the game had
spread to, Butte was a mining town with a significant migrant Chinese
population. The game was played illegally in the backrooms of “cigar stores”,
which also operated as speakeasies. One in particular, the Crown Cigar Store,
was operating the Chinese game in 1927.[@LostButte p. 50] {%fn%}A court case
from 1948 shows that at the Crown the adapted game, using numbers, was at that
time known as “the Crown Game” or the “Crown
[punchboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punchboard)
game”,[@StatevCrownCigarStore] but it was clearly derived from the “Chinese
lottery”.{%endfn%} The gambling operation was managed by two brothers named Joe and
Francis Lyden.{%fn%}Some sources give the name as “Frances”. The Lyden
brothers — Joseph Michael (1899–1982)[@JosephMichaelLyden] and Francis — were
Irish immigrants who had inherited the store from their
step-father.[@LydenBrothers]{%endfn%}

These Butte games were routinely shut down by the police, but in 1931 Nevada
legalized gambling by passing [Assembly Bill No.
98](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Statutes/35th1931/Stats193102.html#Stats193102page165)
(popularly known as the “Wide Open Gambling Bill”). The bill explicitly
legalized “keno”, as long as the person running the game had procured a license
to do so. It is worth noting, given the ongoing theme of anti-Chinese discrimination here,
that these licenses were only available to US citizens, and ‘aliens’ were not allowed
to even _operate_ a licensed game.{%fn%}This seems particularly egregious given that
the distinctly Chinese game of Fan-Tan was also explicitly legalized by the
bill… but only for US citizens!{%endfn%}

At this time, the name “keno” (or “quino”) referred to a Bingo-like game from
the 19th century (see the {%gameref keno-bingo %} article for
more).{%fn%}Interestingly, one of the few books to get the distinction between
‘old’ and ‘new’ Keno straight is @PlayboysIllustratedTreasury [p. 215].{%endfn%}
This game used pre-printed sheets and randomly-drawn numbers, and is not
directly related to the Chinese-derived modern game of Keno, where sheets are
marked by the players.

However, it seems that the Lyden brothers seized upon this opportunity to
rebrand their game under the “keno” name. In 1935 Francis moved to Reno, where
he began to work for John Petricciani, owner of the newly-opened Palace
Club.[@FrancisLydenButteBoy] {%fn%}Joe Lyden doesn’t feature any further in this
story, but he would also later (after 1938?) move to Las Vegas and start the
first Keno game there, at the Fremont.{%endfn%}

### “Chinese Keno”

As early as 1899, the Chinese game had been referred to as “Chinese Keno” to
distinguish it from the existing Keno game.[@ChineseGamblersRaided] Despite
this, earlier attempts to run the Chinese lottery under the “keno” name had
failed: in 1932, one Woo Sing had purchased a Keno license under which to
operate the “Chinese lottery” in the Henry Club{%fn%}One of the earliest
licensed gambling establishments in Reno, located at 133 Lake Street.{%endfn%}
(located in Reno, Nevada), only to have the license revoked by the Reno city
council and his staff arrested.[@LotteryAndKenoContrasted] While the case
against the staff was eventually dropped, Woo Sing was unable to recover his
$300 ($6870 in 2022 dollars) license fee. In May 1933, a J. B. Crane, an
associate of Woo Sing’s, attempted to procure a license to run the game as
“keno”.{%fn%}At the Lucky Club, 233 Lake Street.{%endfn%} Crane stated
(correctly) that the game was not actually a lottery and hence not illegal, and
that his game would use numbers in place of Chinese characters, and the license
was subsequently granted.[@CraneIssuedKeno] By the middle of June the club had
been ordered to stop the game,[@ChineseLotteryOrderedClosed] then permitted to
reopen it,[@ChineseKenoGamesToOperate] until finally Crane’s licenses were
revoked and his club was ordered shut.[@JBCrane]{%fn%}Crane had previously
boasted that the council did not have the power to refuse a license, which must
not have helped his cause.{%endfn%}

Another operator named Walter Tun, who had watched the proceedings closely, also
chose to close his “lottery” operation.[@CouncilRevokesCrane] While all this was
going on there seems to have been something of a turf war between Tun and
Sing,[@ChineseDisputeSettlement] and in July, Woo Sing was shot by an unknown
assailant.{%fn%}The case was never solved, despite a $500 ($11,400 in
2022) reward being offered for information by the Yick Keong Benevolent
Association.{%endfn%} Crane again sought licenses in
July,[@ChineseGamblerIsWounded] and August,[@CouncilAdjournsAndCraneFails] at
which point the petition was referred to a grand jury in
September,[@WashoeCoGrandJury] but I cannot find any further trace of
it.{%fn%}Perhaps the death of Crane’s wife’s father in September brought an end
to his pursuit of the matter.{%endfn%}

A newspaper report of the time shows the confused reaction to Crane’s August
application, as Crane’s lawyer James T. Boyd debated the meaning of “keno” with
City Attorney Pike:[@WeAreRecessed]

> Pike—“Does the license ask for keno? Do they intend to play keno or Chinese
> keno?”
> 
> Boyd—“Try and find a definition for keno?”
> 
> Pike—“I can show you one in [Corpus
> Juris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Juris) and it does not include the
> Chinese game.”
> 
> Boyd—“Does it include the games played in places on Virginia street. Any time
> you take numbered balls out of—”
>
> Pike—“They call the games on Virginia street tango—I don’t think they’re legal
> either.”{%fn%}Tango (from Spanish <span lang="es">tengo</span>, “I have it”)
> at this time also referred to a version of the Bingo-style Keno
> game.[@YouCantMiss] It had been played since 1931 at the Reno Club on Virginia
> Street,[@OpenTodayRenoClub] and the name was probably influenced by the tango
> (dance) which was popular at the time.{%endfn%}

By July 1934, things seem to have calmed down somewhat, as both Walter Tun and
Woo Sing were simultaneously granted keno licenses, to operate at the Star Club
and Public Club, respectively.[@ChineseGrantedKenoLicenses] Despite one
councillor immediately attempting to revoke these licenses, and the debate
reopening upon “Chinese keno”,[@KenoDiscussionAgainHeard] they were apparently
able to operate unmolested until May 1935, at which point the District Attorney
stepped in and ordered them to shut
down.[@ChineseLotteriesOrderedClosed]{%fn%}Woo Sing would eventually be arrested
on narcotics charges in 1937 and the Public Club closed down permanently.{%endfn%}

Despite the repeated failure of these previous cases, Francis Lyden proposed running a
“keno” game in Reno based upon the Chinese lottery, and contacted Warren Nelson,
whom he knew from Butte, to run it at the Palace Club.[@SilvioPetricciani p. 26]
At the time Warren was running games in Great Falls.

Warren had at first run the game in the backroom of the Mint Cigar Store in
Butte.{%fn%}Warren states his father and a man named Cal Lewis ran the game
together in the Mint Cigar Store, but that he was taught the game by a younger
man named Jimmy Shea after his father refused to teach
him.[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 29]{%endfn%} Initially, they had used the same
method of drawing the numbers as in the Chinese version of the game (paper
strips rolled and placed in four containers), but eventually moved on to using
balls which were jumbled in a tumbler. The number of drawings was also increased
to a much faster pace of one every fifteen minutes. It was this version of the
game that was taken to the Palace Club in Nevada.[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p.
34–5, 50–1]

Thus, the first publicly played version of the Americanized game appears to have
been “Race Horse Keno”, which was launched by the Palace Club in Reno in 1936.
The game was given a horse-racing theme, and the Chinese characters were
replaced by the numbers 1 to 80. Balls with these numbers could then be drawn to
determine the “winning horses”. It is interesting to note that this
inadvertently returned the game to its pigeon-racing roots.

{% imageEnd %}

As a game of chance and not a lottery, the “new” game was legal under Nevada
laws.[@SilvioPetricciani p. 26] Warren describes in his own words how the game
was lifted from the Chinese:[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 30]

> Keno, which was originally a Chinese game, was well known throughout the West.
> Everywhere you’d go, Chinese could be found running illegal keno games. Some
> of them had tried to start games in Butte, but their competition, white
> professional gamblers, would get their games closed up. Then a fellow went in
> partners with a Chinaman, and when he learned everything he could from him, he
> kicked him out. The Chinese were looked down upon so much that you could do
> anything to them and no one would say a word.

Despite divorcing the game from its Chinese origins, the keno “writers” who
marked the tickets still used hair brushes imported from China,[@EveryLightWasOn
p. 129] and the ink was purchased from Chinese
suppliers.[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 50]

In this “racehorse” version of the game, each number had a horse’s name assigned
to it, and the names were announced in a similar way to the way that “[bingo
calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_bingo_nicknames)” are now
performed. Other examples of names included:

<div class="columnar">

</div>

Warren also reports and example of the patter (or “ballyhoo”) that was used to
announce the game, mimicking the style of a horse racing
commentator:[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p. 158]

> All right, they’re off and running!<br/>Jockey number 1 on Nanny
> Dee.<br/>Jockey 16 on Mainstreet,<br/>Right down the main drag.<br/>You’ve got

{% imageEnd %}

The Bank Club (the next-door rival of the Palace Club) and Harolds Club were
soon to follow by installing Keno games of their own.[@AlwaysBetOnTheButcher p.
53] In 1938 Warren opened the game at the Nevada Club in Lake
Tahoe.[@WarrenNelson p. 10]

The racehorse version of the game died out some time in the mid
1950s.[@EveryLightWasOn p. 128] However, keno games are still referred to as
**races**.[@CompleteGuideWinningKeno p. 23]

## Keno

Modern Keno is much the same game as the Chinese lottery: the players select their
numbers, the numbers are drawn and displayed — nowadays on an electronic
‘flashboard’ — and any winning bets are paid out.

### Catches, Spots, & Ways

In modern parlance the traditional ticket would be called a 10-**spot** ticket,
as ten numbers were chosen. Many casinos or other operators allow players to
choose 1-spot to 10- or 15-spot tickets, or even higher — some offer 20-spot tickets.

The payoff tables vary depending on the number of spots chosen and are usually
arranged by the number of **catches**: that is, numbers chosen that match the
drawn numbers.

The basic ticket with a certain number of spots chosen is now called a
**straight ticket**. Other ways of marking tickets indicate multiple
simultaneous bets being placed. These bets could be placed as separate bets,
but it is more convenient to mark them on one ticket.

The simplest form of this is a **split ticket**, which has a line (or multiple
lines) drawn across it to separate two or more distinct bets on one ticket.

A **way ticket** has multiple circled groups of numbers written on it.{%fn%}Some
writers distinguish between way tickets and ‘combination’ tickets, where a way
ticket has all groups of the same size. However, this seems to be an unnecessary
distinction.{%endfn%} The player must then **condition** the ticket by
indicating what their intended bets are. For example, if a ticket has three
circled groups of four, this can be used as a 3-way 8-spot ticket (there are
three ways of forming eight spots by combining the groups) by writing “3/8” and
the amonut bet on each way on the ticket. The total cost of the ticket is the
amount bet per way multiplied by the number of ways. The same could also be used
as a 3-way 4-spot ticket (by writing 3/4), and/or also a one-way 12-spot ticket
(1/12), if the player wanted. On a way ticket an individual circled number is
called a **king**, as it greatly increases the number of possible bets.

Extreme versions of the way-ticket include the 190-way 8-spot ticket, where all
80 numbers on the ticket are marked by dividing them into twenty
groups.[@CompleteGuideWinningKeno p. 119] At a rate of 10¢/way, this costs $19
per race!

Casinos provide ‘keno books’ which indicate various ways to mark way tickets and
the corresponding payoffs depending on what catches are made.{%fn%}Examples can
be found here for [Bally’s Las
Vegas](https://archive.org/details/50000kenoballyslv87) or the [Sahara Las
Vegas](https://archive.org/details/kenopayguide). See @CompleteGuideWinningKeno
for more examples.{%endfn%} In some cases certain payoffs are “enhanced” and pay
more than they would on a straight ticket.[@CompleteGuideWinningKeno p. 128] It
has also happened that paybooks have contained mistakes, which has allowed players to
capitalize on better odds for themselves.[@CompleteGuideWinningKeno p. 189]

### Alternative bets

Other ways of placing bets change how the game works: a **catch-all** ticket
only pays if all of your selected numbers match. Conversely, a **catch-zero**
only pays if _no_ numbers are matched. An **all-or-nothing** ticket combines
both of these and wins if either all or none of the numbers match.

A **top** or **bottom** or **left** or **right** ticket is placed by dividing
the ticket in half horizontally (or vertically, depending on the bet to be
placed) and then writing T/B/L/R on the appropriate section to indicate which
half of the ticket has been chosen. No spots are picked for this bet, and it
wins if more numbers are drawn on the chosen half than the non-chosen
half, paying more if more numbers end up there.[@CompleteGuideWinningKeno p. 90]

A **top-or-bottom** or **left-or-right** (also called **top-and-bottom** or
**left-and-right**) bet is placed by marking _both_ sides of the divided ticket.
This bet wins if the distribution of numbers drawn is inequal, and wins more the
more inequal the distribution is (usually requiring at least 13 on one side to
pay out).[@CompleteGuideWinningKeno p. 91]

### Other Keno games

There are many other Keno variants which are invented on a month-by-month basis
by casinos. [Wizard of Odds](https://wizardofodds.com/games/keno/) has an
extensive list on their Keno page.

### Outside the casino: “Lottery” Keno

{% image src="keno_ticket.jpg" alt="" %}

{% imageEnd %}

Keno is also run as a large-scale operation by lotteries operators. In this form
of the game, only ‘straight’ tickets may be played — due to the number of
different ways a ticket may be marked, the job of the ticket writers is highly
skilled and not easily constrained to a computerizable form.
