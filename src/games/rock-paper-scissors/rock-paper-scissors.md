The game of <span class="aka">Rock, Paper, Scissors</span> at times feels so embedded in our(?!) culture that it seems like it must have been around forever. Most people react incredulously when told that it was only introduced to the Anglophone world in the 20th century.

Originally a Japanese game, <span lang="ja" class="aka">じゃん拳</span> <span lang="ja-Latn" class="aka">janken</span>.

As last as 1943, it was poorly-known in the USA: [@BrewsterSomeGames 113]
