Also spelled Liehchih (Learchur) - https://askalexander.org/display/20772/Catalogue+of+the+Collection+of+Playing+Cards+Bequeathed+to+the+Trustees+of+the+British+Museum+by+the+Late+Lady+Charlotte+Schreiber/203?pw=stagflower

Top three cards in the (reversed) coins suit are:

- "Cloud coin" (red stamped)
- "Stag flower" (no stamp)
- "Prince of Mao" (red stamp)

"Cloud Coin" could be a strange misreading of 焦挺 which had been written as 焦𡈼 and then merged into a single character. This is the name used on that card (the 1 Coin) in the BM deck, for example. Also look at the variant in Ostasiatische Spielkarten.
