The playing-card ‘jack’ was originally called a “knave”; the term “jack” seems to have come about specifically in association with the game of All-Fours.

In the early 17th century, the costumes of the playing cards were already considered outdated; Samuel Rowlands’ <cite>The Knave of Harts</cite> (1612) contains the following poem entitled “The Knaue of <i>Harts</i> his Supplication to Card-markers” (if the poem is too long, I have em<b>bold</b>ened an interesting section):[@KnaveOfHarts]

> VVEe are abuſed in a great degree;<br>
For, there’s no Knaues ſo wronged as are wee<br>
By thoſe that chiefely ſhould be our part-takers:<br>
And thus it is my Maiſters, you <em>Card-makers</em>,<br>
All other Knaues are at their owne free-will,<br>
To braue it out, and follow faſhion ſtill<br>
In any cut, according to the time,<br>
But we poore Knaues (I know not for what crime)<br>
Are kept in pie-bald Suites, which we haue worne<br>
Hundreds of yeares, this hardly can be borne.<br>
The idle-headed French deuis’d vs firſt,<br>
Who of all faſion-mongers is the worſt:<br>
For, he doth change farre oftner than the Moone,<br>
Diſlikes his morning ſuite in th’ after-noone.<br>
The Engliſh is his imitating Ape,<br>
In euery toy the Tailers-ſheares can ſhape,<br>
Come dropping after, as the Diuell entices,<br>
And putteth on the French-mans cast deuiſes.<br>
Yet wee (with whom thus long they bouth haue plaid)<br>
Muſt weare the ſuites in which we firſt were made.<br>
It is no maruell euery baſe Conſort,<br>
When he hath loſt his money, will report<br>
All ill of vs, and giueth theſe rewards,<br>
A poxe vpon theſe ſcuruy, lowſie Cardes:<br>
How can we chooſe but haue the itching gift,<br>
Kept in one kinde of cloaths, and neuer ſhift?<br>
Or, to be ſcuruie, how can we forbeare,<br>
That neuer yet had ſhirt or band to weare?<br>
How bad I and my fellow <em>Dimond</em> goes,<br>
We neuer yet had Garter to our Hoſe,<br>
Nor any Shooe to put vpon our feete,<br>
<b>With ſuch baſe cloaths, tis e’en a ſhame to ſe’et:<br>
My Sleeues are like ſome Morris-dancing fellow,<br>
My Stockings Ideot-like, red, greene and yealow:<br>
My Breeches like a paire of Lute-pins be,<br>
Scarſe Buttocke-room, as euery man may ſee.<br>
Like three-penie watch-men, three of vs doe ſtand,<br>
Each with a ruſtie Browne-bill in his hand:<br>
And <em>Clubs</em> he holds an Arrow, like a Clowne,<br>
The head-end vpward, and the feathers downe.</b><br>
Thus we are wrong’d and thus we are agrieu’d,<br>
And thus long time we haue been unrelieu’d.<br>
But <em>Card-makers</em>, of you, <em>Harts</em> reaſon craues,<br>
Why we ſhould be reſtraind, aboue all Knaues,<br>
To weare ſuch patched and diſguis’d attire?<br>
Anſwere but this, of kindneſſe, we require:<br>
Shew vs (I pray) ſome reaſon, how it haps,<br>
That we are euer bound to weare flat-Caps.<br>
As though we had vnto a Cities trade,<br>
Bin Prentiſes, and ſo were free-men made.<br>
Had we blacke Gownes, vpon my life I ſweare,<br>
Many would ſay that we foure Serieants were:<br>
And that would brind Card-play in ſmall requeſt<br>
With Gallants that were fearefull of arreſt:<br>
For, melancholy they would euer be<br>
A Seriants picture in their hands to ſee:<br>
Others that <em>Clubs</em> and <em>Spades</em> apparrell notes,<br>
Becauſe they both are in ſide-guarded Coates,<br>
Tearme them to Vſurers, villanous rich,<br>
To whom the Diuell is beholden much,<br>
And loues their Trades of getting gold ſo well,<br>
They ſhall be welcome to his flames in Hell.<br>
Others say, if we had white Aprons on,<br>
We would be like vnto <em>A non, A non,<br>
VVhat is it Gentleman you pleaſe to drinke?</em><br>
And ſome, becauſe we haue no beards, doe thinke<br>
We are foure Panders, with our lowſie lockes,<br>
Whoſe naked Chinnes are ſhauen with the Poxe:<br>
Diuers opinions there be other ſhowes,<br>
Becauſe we walke in Jerkins and in Hoſe,<br>
Without an vpper Garment, Cloake, or Gowne,<br>
We muſt be Tapſters running vp and downe<br>
With Cannes of Beere, (Malt ſod in fiſhes broth)<br>
And thoſe they ſay are fil’d with <em>Nick</em> and <em>Froth</em>.<br>
Other auouch w’are of the ſmoky crew,<br>
A trade that ſtinckes, although it be but new,<br>
Such Fellowes as ſit all the day in ſmother,<br>
And drinke, like Diuels, fire to each other.<br>
Thus are we plaid vpon by each baſe Groome.<br>
Nay, let a paire of Cards lye in a roome,<br>
Where any idle fellow commeth in,<br>
The Knaues hee’ll ſingle out, and thus begin;<br>
Here are foure Millers for their honeſt dealing:<br>
Or Tailers, for the gift they haue in ſtealing:<br>
Or Brokers, for their buying things are ſtole:<br>
Or Bakers, for their looking throw a hole:<br>
Or Colliers, for not filling of their Sackes:<br>
Thus we are plaid vpon by ſawcy Iackes,<br>
And therefore if perſwaſions may but winne you,<br>
Good <em>Card-makers</em>, (if there be any goodnes in you)<br>
Apparrell vs with more reſpected Care,<br>
Put vs in Hats, our Caps are worne thread-bare,<br>
Let us haue ſtanding Collers, in the faſhion:<br>
(All are become a ſtiffe-necke generation)<br>
Roſe Hat-bands, with the ſhagged-ragged-Ruffe:<br>
Great Cabbage-ſhooeſtrings (pray you bigge enough)<br>
French Doublet, and the Spaniſh Hoſe to breech it:<br>
Short Cloakes, like old Mandilions (wee beſeech it)<br>
Exchange our Swords, and take away our Bils,<br>
Let vs haue Rapiers, (knaues loue fight that kils)<br>
Put vs in Bootes, and make vs leather legs,<br>
This <em>Harts</em> moſt humbly, and his fellowes begs.<br>
