### California Jack

earliest reference found @SketchingsWestCampton, apparently in an early edition of <cite>The American Hoyle</cite>, (see: https://archive.org/details/firesidegamesfor00frik/page/n151/mode/2up?q=%22california+jack%22) but i haven't found anything earlier than @TheAmericanHoyle3

Popular in the 1860s? https://archive.org/details/recollectionsoff00barn/page/n349/mode/2up?q=%22california+jack%22

Still played in the 1920s: https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofmas5719mass/page/450/mode/2up?q=euchre

Same as French Fours? [@TheModernPocketHoyle4 p. 166]
