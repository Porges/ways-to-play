<p class="lead">
<span class="aka">Hazard</span> is a very old dice game; in fact, it was the name of the game before the word “hazard” meant anything else in English. The modern meaning is derived from the <em>hazardous</em> nature of the game.
The word originally comes from Arabic <span lang="ar">الزهر</span> (<span lang="ar">اَلزَّهْر</span>) <span lang="ar-Latn">al-zahr</span> ‘the flowers’, a name for dice, via Middle French <span lang="fr">hasard</span>. It has also been called <span class="aka">Crabs</span> or <span class="aka">Krabs</span>.[@TheorieDesJeuxDeHasard]

A gambling game with two dice in which the chances are complicated by a number of arbitrary rules.

## Play

The player first rolls the two dice repeatedly until they result in a sum from five to nine, inclusive. This is called the **main**. Next, they roll one more time to establish their **chance** (target), and see if they can **nick** the main and win instantly, or if they **out** (lose). The target number for nicking or outing is determined by the main; a roll of 2 or 3 (**crabs** or **craps**) always outs and loses:

- 5 is nicked by 5, outs on 2, 3, 11, or 12
- 6 is nicked by 6 or 12, outs on 2, 3, or 11
- 7 is nicked by 7 or 11, outs on 2, 3, or 12
- 8 is nicked by 8 or 12, outs on 2, 3, or 11
- 9 is nicked by 9, outs on 2, 3, 11, or 12

Any other result establishes the **chance**. The player then rolls the dice repeatedly until they either roll the chance again, in which case they win, or roll the main, when they lose.

## Analysis

The odds of each outcome are as follows:

<table class="table rule-last-col">
<thead>
<th rowspan="2">Main</th>
<th rowspan="2">Nick</th>
<th rowspan="2">Out</th>
<th colspan="2">Chance</th>
<th rowspan="2">Success</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Win</th>
<th>Loss</th>
<tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="numeric table-group-divider">
<tr><th scope="row">5</th><td>1.85%</td><td>2.78%</td><td>6.36%</td><td>5.68%</td><td>49.24%</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">6</th><td>3.47%</td><td>2.89%</td><td>6.70%</td><td>7.77%</td><td>48.83%</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">7</th><td>5.56%</td><td>2.78%</td><td>6.77%</td><td>9.90%</td><td>49.29%</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">8</th><td>3.47%</td><td>2.89%</td><td>6.70%</td><td>7.77%</td><td>48.83%</td></tr>
<tr><th scope="row">9</th><td>1.85%</td><td>2.78%</td><td>6.36%</td><td>5.68%</td><td>49.24%</td></tr>
</tbody>
<tfoot class="numeric table-group-divider">
<tr>
<th scope="row">Overall</td>
<td class="bg-success text-white">16.20%</td>
<td class="bg-danger text-white">14.12%</td>
<td class="bg-success text-white">32.88%</td>
<td class="bg-danger text-white">36.80%</td>
<td>49.08%</td>
</tr>
</tfoot>
</table>

Thus the overall chance of success for the shooter is 49.08%, and the disadvantage for the player is &minus;1.84%.

In some versions of the game the player is allowed to select any valid main before rolling; in this case the best selection is 7.

The modern game of Craps is based upon Hazard with a fixed main of seven; the come-out roll is the roll which determines the chance (“point”). This is why the shooter craps out on 2, 3, or 12, and wins on 7 or 11 (a “natural”).
