<span class="aka">Hazard</span> is a very old dice game — in fact, it was the name of the game before the word “hazard” meant anything else in English, and the modern meaning of the word is derived from the <em>hazardous</em> nature of the game. It has also been spelled <span class="aka">Hasard</span>, <span class="aka">Hassard</span>, or <span class="aka">Hazzard</span>.

The word originally comes from Arabic <span lang="ar">الزهر</span> (<span lang="ar">اَلزَّهْر</span>) <span lang="ar-Latn">al-zahr</span> ‘the flowers’, a name for dice, via Spanish <span lang="es">azar</span> and Middle French <span lang="fr" class="aka">hasard</span>. The original game which was called <span lang="es">azar</span> in Alfonso X’s @AlfonsoGames (1283) used three dice; the version described here was at the time possibly called <span lang="es" class="aka">azar con dos dados</span>.[@GreedForGain 15]

The game described here has also been called <span class="aka">Crabs</span> or <span class="aka">Krabs</span>.[@TheorieDesJeuxDeHasard] Later French books seem to believe that the game was of English origin.[@TheorieDesJeuxDeHasard p. 8]

Charles Cotton says that Hazard is the “moſt bewitching Game that is plaid on the dice; for when a man begins to play he knows not when to leave off”,[@CompleatGamester p. 172][^fn1] and that “Hazzard is a proper name for this game; for it ſpeedily makes a man or undoes him; in the twinkling of an eye either a Man or a Mouſe.”[@CompleatGamester p. 168]

[^fn1]: This page misnumbered 127 instead of 172.

The <abbr class="initialism">OED</abbr> has a somewhat amusing definition of the game:

<blockquote class="epigraph">
A gambling game with two dice in which the chances are complicated by a number of arbitrary rules.
</blockquote>

Rules for the game appear in {%a hoyle,Hoyle’s%} from the 1775 Charles Jones edition,[^fn2] when Hazard was added to the existing text.[@HoylesGamesImproved1775 p. 223]

[^fn2]: The <abbr class="initialism">OED</abbr> cites the 1778 _Thomas_ Jones edition, but this is a later piracy of the Charles Jones version.

## Play

The player first rolls the two dice repeatedly until they result in a sum from five to nine, inclusive. This is called the **main**. Next, they roll one more time to establish their **chance** (target), and see if they can **nick** the main and win instantly, or if they **out** (lose). The target number for nicking or outing is determined by the main; a roll of 2 or 3 (**crabs** or **craps**) always outs and loses:

- 5 is nicked by 5, outs on 2, 3, 11, or 12
- 6 is nicked by 6 or 12, outs on 2, 3, or 11
- 7 is nicked by 7 or 11, outs on 2, 3, or 12
- 8 is nicked by 8 or 12, outs on 2, 3, or 11
- 9 is nicked by 9, outs on 2, 3, 11, or 12

Any other result establishes the **chance**. The player then rolls the dice repeatedly until they either roll the chance again, in which case they win, or roll the main, when they lose.

If a player wins they are paid their stake by those who bet against them; if they lose their stake is lost.

Thus the overall chance of success for the shooter is 49.08%, and the disadvantage for the player &minus;1.84%.

In some (later) versions of the game the player is allowed to select any valid main before rolling;[@VotariesII p. 317] in this case the best selection is clearly 7, based upon the above table.

## The Banking Game

When played against a bank, the game needed to be made unfair in some way so that the bank was guaranteed a profit.[^fn3] Sometimes the banking game was called <span class="aka">French Hazard</span> and the non-banking version <span class="aka">English Hazard</span> or <span class="aka">Chicken Hazard</span>.[@BarristersLife p. 43]

[^fn3]: I do not yet have details about how this change was made.

## See also

The modern game of Craps is based upon Hazard with a fixed main of seven; the come-out roll is the roll which determines the chance (“point”). This is why the shooter craps out on 2, 3, or 12, and wins on 7 or 11 (a “natural”).
