# Five Card

<span class="aka">Five Card</span> is a game that is similar to the Japanese [Oicho Kabu](games/three-card-game/three-card-game.md#oicho-kabu). It is played both in Japan, where it probably originated, as well as amongst Aboriginal people in the north of Australia.

The name is given with various local pronunciations as <span lang="tiw">paipkad</span>[@GamblingHardWork p. 13] or <span>bayb kad</span>.[@EthnographicPsychology p. 271]

The Australian game is almost certainly — like other <span lang="ja-Latn">kabu</span> games played in the Northern Territories — derived from a Japanese game. In the 1970s, @EthnographicPsychology [p. 272] reported that people living at [Barunga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barunga,_Northern_Territory)[^fn0] said that they had been taught the game by a [Tiwi person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwi_people) from [Bathurst Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathurst_Island_(Northern_Territory)) during their stay at Tandangal in 1949–51. @GamblingHardWork [p. 11] also reported seeing versions of the game amongst the Tiwi people on [Melville Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melville_Island_(Northern_Territory)) in the 1950s. Japanese pearlers had been operating off the coasts of the Tiwi islands since the early 20th century.

[^fn0]: Formerly ‘Bamyili’.

Strong linguistic evidence for the Japanese origin of the Aboriginal game is the name used by the [Kunwinjku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunwinjku_people)[^fn1] people,[@HunterGatherersState p. 291] or other groups around [Maningrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maningrida,_Northern_Territory),[@CardGamesToPokerMachines p. 101] where this five-card variant of the game is called <span lang="gup" class="aka">butakat</span> or <span class="aka" lang="gup">buta</span>. This is not a Kunwinjku term,[^fn2] but the slang word for ‘zero’ amongst Japanese gamblers (see the [Oicho Kabu](games/three-card-game/three-card-game.md#oicho-kabu) article for more on Japanese terminology), and relates to an important aspect of that game.

[^fn1]: Formerly ‘Gunwinggu’.

[^fn2]: Kunwinjku numbers are easily identifiable and work on a base-5 system; the word for five is <span lang="gup">kunbidkudji</span>.

In Japan it now known as <span lang="ja" class="aka">五枚株</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn" class="aka">gomai kabu</span>, ‘five card <span lang="ja-Latn">kabu</span>’).

[^fn3]: @CardGamesAmongAborigines also says that the Chinese name of the game is said to be <span lang="zh-Latn">luk luk fāt</span>. I have not been able to find a Chinese game under this name yet, but it could be something along the lines of <span lang="zh">祿祿發</span>/<span lang="zh">路路發</span>, with Cantonese pronunciation <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">luk⁶ luk⁶ fat¹</span>/<span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">lou⁶ lou⁶ fat¹</span>, which is very similar to ‘668’ in pronunciation. This number is still used in the name of card game brands. 

> [!todo] (Re above footnote, Could this be the source of the "sticks" game given in some places?)

@CardGamesAmongAborigines [p. 250]  Also called "putkad" or "tent" (10).


## <span class="aka">Bullfighting</span>

The equivalent game played with Chinese dominoes is known as Bullfighting (<span lang="yue" class="aka">鬥牛</span>, Cantonese: <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping" class="aka">dau³ ngau⁴</span>).[^fn4] It can also be played with domino cards or mahjong tiles, and has been played throughout Malaysia.[@GamblingGamesOfMalaya p. 88] It remains illegal in Singapore except as part of social gambling.[@SingaporeGamesOfChanceAndSkill]

[^fn4]: This is often transliterated <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping" class="aka">Tau Ngau</span>. I think also that perhaps <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">ngau⁴</span> (<span lang="yue">牛</span>) ‘bull’ is a pun on <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">ngau⁵</span> (<span lang="yue">偶</span>) ‘pair’, so that the original name of the game is really ‘comparing pairs’. The book @ThingsChinese [p. 584] mentions the domino card game <span lang="yue-Latn">ngaú-p‘áí</span>, presumably <span lang="zh">牛牌</span> “bull cards”, but with no further information. It is possible this is the same game.

It is possible that the Chinese game is the original source of the Japanese one, but it is not clear to me at this point due to differences in the the way that they are played.
