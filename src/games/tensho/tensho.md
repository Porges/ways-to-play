# <span lang="ja">テンショ</span> · <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Tensho</span>

<span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun aka">Tensho</span> (<span lang="ja" class="aka">テンショ</span>) is a <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Hanafuda</span> game from <span
lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Nagoya</span> in Japan. It is played with an unusual
deck ordering and <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> that are not found in other <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Hanafuda</span> games.

## History

An interesting thing about <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Tenshō</span> is that it appears to have originally been a game played with a <span lang="ja-Latn">mekuri</span> deck that was later transferred to the <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Hanafuda</span> deck.

A Japanese Department of Justice report from 1927[@NagoyaReport f. 13–15, 52–56] describes the game being played with <span lang="ja-Latn">mekuri</span> cards,[^fn0] with the following mapping between <span lang="ja-Latn">mekuri</span> and <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Hanafuda</span> decks:

[^fn0]: I have not yet identified the precise style of deck used.

## Play

Firstly, <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Tenshō</span> uses what might be
called the “<span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Nagoya</span> ordering” of the
months. This differs from the standard ordering in the following way:

<ol class="columnar">
<li>
Pine
</li>
<li>
**Willow**
</li>
<li>
Cherry
</li>
<li>
Wisteria
</li>
<li>
Iris
</li>
<li>
**Paulownia**
</li>
<li>
Bush Clover
</li>
<li>
Miscanthus
</li>
<li>
Chrysanthemum
</li>
<li>
Maple
</li>
<li>
**Peony**
</li>
<li>
**Plum**
</li>
</ol>
