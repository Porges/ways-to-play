# Take It Away
<span class="aka">Take It Away</span> is a game for 2–4 players invented by Sid Sackson,[@Gamut 142–3] in which players try to achieve the highest score by capturing from a
shared set of pieces on the board.

## Play

### Equipment

To play you will need an 8×8 chess or checkerboard, and 64 coloured pieces
(Sackson suggests poker chips): 34 white, 20 red, and 10 blue.

### Setup

Arrange the pieces randomly, one on each square of the board.

> A sample initial configuration.


### Game
The first player starts the game by removing any white chip from the board and
placing it in front of themselves. This counts as one of their captured pieces.
A captured piece counts as points at the end of the game: 3 points for a blue
piece, 2 points for a red piece, and 1 point for white.

After this, the players take turns jumping a piece over another (including
diagonally) and capturing the jumped piece. Multiple jumps may be made, and
direction can change during the jump sequence. If a jump can be continued then
it must be.

#### “Take It Away”

A player can drop out of the game at the start of their turn by declaring “take
it away”.

The last player left in the game continues taking turns by themselves until they
cannot make any more captures. The remaining pieces on the board count against
their points at 2× (variation: 4×) their normal value.

## Variations

### The open game

For the first 8 turns players simply remove a single white piece from the board.
Play continues after this as usual.

### No dropping out

A player cannot declare “take it away”, and no player is penalized for pieces
remaining on the board.

## <span class="aka">Acquisitions</span>

This is a very similar game given in @100Other [p. 72–3], and which seems to have been influenced by Take It Away, although the game is not referenced.

This version uses 63 undifferentiated pieces (although differentiated pieces may be used as above, in which case the game is essentially identical to Take It Away), which are placed on a chessboard. One corner is left empty. Players then take turns jumping and capturing as above. Whoever captures the most pieces is the winner.

The drop-out rule is also possible as a variation; one player may drop out on their turn, and their opponent continues making captures until they cannot make any more. Any pieces left on the board count against their score.
