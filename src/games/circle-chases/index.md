<p class="lead">
Under this title, I collect several children’s games which are very similar and
involve most of the players sitting or standing in a circle while another player
walks around the outside of it until they choose someone (with or without their knowing,
according to the game), who must then chase them.

The most obvious modern version of this game is ‘Duck, Duck, Goose’.

## History

Games of this type date at least from Roman times. The Greek scholar [Julius
Pollux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Pollux) wrote of a game called
<span lang="el-polyton-Latn">schoinofílíndá</span> (<span
lang="el-polyton">σχοινοφῖλίνδᾶ</span>){%fn%}Also written <span
lang="el-monoton">σχοινοφιλίνδα</span> or <span
lang="el-monoton">σχοινοβιλίνδα</span>.[@GreekEnglishLexicon p. 1459]{%endfn%}
in his proto-encyclopædia <cite>Onomasticon</cite> (<span
lang="el-polyton">Ὀνομαστικὸν</span>, {%c%} 200 {%ce%}):

> ἡ δὲ σχοινοφιλίνδα, κάθηται κύκλος, εἷς δὲ σχοινίον ἔχων ἐλθὼν παρ’ αὐτῷ
> τίθησι· κἂν μὲν ἀγνοήσῃ ἐκεῖνος παρ’ ᾧ κεῖται, περιθέων περὶ τὸν κύκλον
> τύπτεται, εἰ δὲ μάθοι περιελαύνει τὸν θέοντα τύπτων [Book 9,
> 115]{%fn%}Unfortunately I do not yet have a good translation of this
> passage.{%endfn%}

The game involved one player walking around the outside of the circle with a
piece of rope, who attempted to drop or place it behind a player without them
noticing. The chosen player would then chase the other player with the rope and
strike at them before the chooser could return to the chosen’s original
position. If the chosen player did not notice, the chooser would then chase them
instead.

See [@ChildrensGamesInStreet p. 198–206]

Later Greek–English dictionaries offer the names of games which were current at
the time, that are useful as points of reference for how the game was
understood.

A 1585 edition of [Hadrianus
Junius’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrianus_Junius)
<cite>Nomenclator</cite> produced by [Abraham
Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Fleming) has “Schœnophilinda”
with the definition “A kinde of playe called clowt clowt, to beare about, or my
hen hath layd.”[@Nomenclator1585] Here ‘clowt’ (=‘clout’) is an old word meaning
‘a piece of cloth’, so a modern equivalent of the name could be ‘cloth, cloth,
to carry around’.{%fn%}Later dictionaries copy this definition in a corrupted
manner; [John Rider’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rider_(bishop))
English–Latin dictionary of 1589 has “Schenophilanda” “clout clout to beare
about, or my hen hath laid”;[@Rider1589] Thomas Thomas’ dictionary (in its 3rd
edition of 1592) has “Schœnophilanda” “clowt, clowt, to beare about, or my henne
hath laide”,[@ThomasThomas1592] and an edition of Rider’s dictionary with
additions by [Francis Holyoake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Holyoake)
from 1617 has “Schænophilanda” “clout clout to beare about, or my hen hath
laid”.[@Rider1640]{%endfn%}

Some comparisons are inaccurate; @AthleticsOfGreeks1 [p. 55] compares the game
to “hunt the slipper”, a Victorian parlour game more akin to Pass-the-Parcel.

However, “hunt the squirrel” does seem to be very
similar; “drop-glove” also listed.[@GamesAndSongsAmericanChildren p. 168]
