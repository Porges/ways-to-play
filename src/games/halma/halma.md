## History

George Monks, an American surgeon, developed the game after his brother (Robert Monks) saw the game “Hoppity” while on a trip to England.[@HalmaHistory] Monks was awarded US patent [383,653](https://patents.google.com/patent/US383653A) for the game.

The game was named Halma by Thomas Hill (Robert Monks’ father-in-law) from the Ancient Greek <span lang="grc">ἅλμα</span> (<span lang="grc-Latn">hálma</span>), ‘jump’.

The game was first published by E.I. Horsman in the USA. Milton Bradley also published the game under the name ‘Halma’ for three years until they were forced to change their version to ‘Eckha’.[^brodley][@BradleysGames p. 3] Parker Brothers claims that George Monks later sold his patent to them.

[^brodley]: Note that the patent lists “Milton Brodley” as a signer. I don’t know if this is a mistake or something more sinister!

## Variants

### Star Halma (“Chinese Checkers”)

In 1892, Ravensburger (a German board game manufacturer) published ‘<span lang="de" class="noun">Stern-Halma</span>’ (Star Halma).

The board was changed into a star shape, and this allowed up to six players to play at once. This game later became known as Chinese Checkers.

There is a version with 10 and a version with 15 pieces per player.
