In English, this game is usually known by its Italian name of “<span class="aka" lang="it">morra</span>”.[@MacedonianFolklore p. 297] In Latin it was known as <span lang="la" class="aka">micatio</span>[@StudyOfGames p.  65] or <span lang="la" class="aka">micare digitis</span>.[@IlGiuocoDellaMorra]

In Ancient Greek it was called ‘finger crossing’ (<span lang="el-polyton">ἡ ἐπάλλαξις
τῶν δακτύλων</span> <span lang="el-polyton-Latn">hē epállaxis tôn daktúlōn</span>, or
<span lang="el-polyton">δακτύλων ἐπάλλαξις</span> <span lang="el-polyton-Latn">daktúlōn
epállaxis</span>).[@AtlasClassicalAntiquities p. 151] In Greece it was usually
played with a rod or wand, which was held with the left hand.
