<p class="lead">
This is a finger-guessing game which English is usually known by its Italian name of “<span class="aka" lang="it">morra</span>”.[@MacedonianFolklore p. 297] However, it has been around for a long time and very similar games are played in many countries throughout the world; in Latin it was known as <span lang="la" class="aka">micatio</span>[@StudyOfGames p.  65] or <span lang="la" class="aka">micare digitis</span>.[@IlGiuocoDellaMorra]
</p>

In Ancient Greek it was called ‘finger crossing’ (<span lang="el-polyton" class="aka">ἡ ἐπάλλαξις τῶν δακτύλων</span> <span lang="el-Latn-polyton" class="aka">hē epállaxis tôn daktúlōn</span>, or <span lang="el-polyton" class="aka">δακτύλων ἐπάλλαξις</span> <span lang="el-Latn-polyton" class="aka">daktúlōn epállaxis</span>).[@AtlasClassicalAntiquities p. 151] In this time it was usually played with a rod or wand, which was held with the left hand. In modern Greek it is called <span lang="el" class="aka">μόρρα</span>, after the Italian name.

In French it is called <span lang="fr" class="aka">mourre</span>. In German it was once called <span lang="de" class="aka">Munke</span>,[@IuKiaoLi p. 285] although it is now known as <span lang="de" class="aka">Mora</span> or <span lang="de" class="aka">Morra</span> after the Italian.

In Italy to play the game was <span lang="it">givocare alla mora</span>
In Lombardy it was called <span lang="lmo" class="aka">buttàre al tocco</span>.[@GameOfMicatioDigitorum p. 509]

## Play

To play the game, both players stand facing each other. They simultaneously raise their hands with 0–5 fingers showing, and call out the **total** number of fingers that they think will be showing. If they get this correct, they are the winner.

On the 5th of April, 1872, the Nuisances Ordinance of Hong Kong (No. 2 of 1872) placed restrictions upon the game:{%fn%}This was later integrated as part of the Summary Offences Ordinance.[@LawAndRacism p. 248][@SummaryOffencesHongKong]{%endfn%}

> 4. (Penalty for playing Chai-mui at night.) Every person shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten dollars who shall utter shouts or cries or make other noises while playing the game known as Chai-mui, between the hours of 11 P.M. and 6 A.M. within any district or place not permitted by some regulation of the Governor in Council.[@NuisancesOrdinanceHongKong]
