In English, this game is usually known by its Italian name of “<span class="aka" lang="it">morra</span>”.[@MacedonianFolklore p. 297] In Latin it was known as <span lang="la" class="aka">micatio</span>[@StudyOfGames p.  65] or <span lang="la" class="aka">micare digitis</span>.[@IlGiuocoDellaMorra]

In Ancient Greek it was called ‘finger crossing’ (<span lang="el-polyton" class="aka">ἡ ἐπάλλαξις τῶν δακτύλων</span> <span lang="el-Latn-polyton" class="aka">hē epállaxis tôn daktúlōn</span>, or <span lang="el-polyton" class="aka">δακτύλων ἐπάλλαξις</span> <span lang="el-Latn-polyton" class="aka">daktúlōn epállaxis</span>).[@AtlasClassicalAntiquities p. 151] In this time it was usually played with a rod or wand, which was held with the left hand. In modern Greek it is called <span lang="el" class="aka">μόρρα</span>, after the Italian name.

In French it is called <span lang="fr" class="aka">mourre</span>. In German it was once called <span lang="de" class="aka">Munke</span>,[@IuKiaoLi p. 285] although it is now known as <span lang="de" class="aka">Mora</span> or <span lang="de" class="aka">Morra</span> after the Italian.

On the 5th of April, 1872, the Nuisances Ordinance of Hong Kong (No. 2 of 1872) placed restrictions upon the game:{%fn%}This was later integrated as part of the Summary Offences Ordinance.[@LawAndRacism p. 248][@SummaryOffencesHongKong]{%endfn%}

> 4. (Penalty for playing Chai-mui at night.) Every person shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten dollars who shall utter shouts or cries or make other noises while playing the game known as Chai-mui, between the hours of 11 P.M. and 6 A.M. within any district or place not permitted by some regulation of the Governor in Council.[@NuisancesOrdinanceHongKong]
