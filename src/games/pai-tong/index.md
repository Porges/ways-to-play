<p class="lead">
<span class="noun aka" lang="th-Latn">Pai Tong</span> (<span lang="th" class="aka">ไพ่ตอง</span>, ‘<span lang="th-Latn">tong</span> cards’) is a draw-and-discard card game from Thailand, played with Thai money cards. It is also known as <span class="noun" lang="th-Latn" class="aka">Pai Phong (Thai)</span> (<span lang="th" class="aka">ไพ่ผ่อง(ไทย)</span>){%fn%}The name <span lang="th-Latn">pai phong</span> could be from Hokkien <span lang="zh">碰牌</span> <span lang="nan-Latn">phòng pâi</span>, ‘bump cards’. This terminology is also used in the game of {%gameref mahjong%}, where <span lang="zh">碰</span> — usually “pong” in English rules — is the call for claiming a tile to form a set of three identical tiles. For the derivation of <span lang="th-latn">tong</span>, see below.{%endfn%} or <span class="noun" lang="th-Latn" class="aka">Pai Chot</span> (<span lang="th" class="aka">ไพ่จอด</span>).[@ThaiGambling p. 71–6] Very similar games are also played in Kelantan in Malaysia.

### Equipment

The game is played with six or seven people and uses two full decks of
money-suited cards (120 cards total, four copies of each card). Any style of
card will work.

In Thailand playing cards are produced by government monopoly, so all decks are
the same. Under the Gambling Act of 1935, the game may not be played for money without explicit permission.[@PaiPong]

### Setup & Play

{%endaside%}

Shuffle the cards, and deal six cards to all players, then a second round of six cards to the starting player and five cards to all others, so that the starting player has 12 cards and the rest 11. Place the remainder of the cards face down in the middle to form the stock.

The first player starts the game by discarding any card face-up. Play proceeds with the next player in an anti-clockwise direction.

On a player’s turn they draw one card from either the top of discard pile or the top of the stock, and then — unless they have won the game by completing their hand — they discard one. 

The goal of the game is to form a complete hand of 12 cards, comprising four sets of three. Each set must consist of three cards of the same rank.A set of three identical cards of the same rank is called a **<span lang="th-Latn">tong</span>** (<span lang="th">ตอง</span>),{%fn%}This term — possibly derived from the Chinese <span lang="zh">同</span> (Hokkien: <span lang="nan-Latn">tông</span>; Teochew: <span lang="tws-Latn">tong⁵</span> Mandarin: <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">tóng</span>; Cantonese: <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">tung⁴</span>) ‘same; identical’ — is also used in other card games to describe a triplet, or a number with three identical digits.{%endfn%} and a set of three different cards is called a **head** (<span lang="th">เศียร</span> <span lang="th-Latn">siian</span>). A set of two identical cards and one other is called a **group** (<span lang="th">พวก</span> <span lang="th-Latn">phuak</span>). Heads and <span lang="th-Latn">tong</span>s are worth more in the scoring.

For the purposes of forming heads, the honour cards or aces are grouped into two sets; one set comprises the two red stamped cards and the 1 Myriads, and other set is made up of the other three cards. To form a head using these cards requires them to be of the same set.

After a player has discarded a card and before the next player picks up a card, any player can claim the discarded card to complete a <span lang="th-Latn">tong</span> by calling “pong”. The claiming player takes the discard and must expose all cards forming the <span lang="th-Latn">tong</span> face-up on the table, then finishes their turn by discarding as usual. (This disrupts the normal order of play, and play continues from the player on their right.)

There are possibly variants in play here for the final card:

To win by completing the 4 sets of cards (called <span lang="th">กิน</span> <span lang="th-Latn">kin</span> ‘eating’), the final card must be drawn from the deck.
 
If a player only requires one card to win, they may take the winning card from
*any* player’s discard to complete their hand. If multiple players try to claim
the same card to win, the next one in seating order takes it.

## Pong

The game is also played in Malaysia under the name <span class="noun aka" lang="ms">Pong</span>. In @GamblingGamesOfMalaya [p. 137–8] it is described as being played with Mahjong tiles, but I think it is probably also played with {%a ceki%}. According to the book, it is played in the state of [Kelantan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelantan), which is adjacent to Thailand.

In Malaysia it is only played with four players.

To play with Mahjong tiles, use 120 tiles: all of the suited (circle, bamboo,
character) tiles, as well as the honour (“dragon”) tiles, but no winds or
flowers.

To deal, build them into four walls of 30 tiles (15 long × 2 high), then draw
the tiles one at a time from the wall in a clockwise direction, as in Mahjong.

Play and win as in the Thai game.

A set of three identical cards or tiles is again called a <span lang="ms">tong</span>,
a set of three mixed tiles is called a <span lang="ms">tong serong</span>
(“crooked <span lang="ms">tong</span>”).

The winning player scores 2 points + 1 point for each pure <span
lang="ms">tong</span> they have in their hand. Thus, the scores range from only
2 points for a hand containing four <span lang="ms">tong serong</span>, up to 6
points for a hand containing four <span lang="ms">tong</span>. Payment may be
collected from the other players on the basis of some fixed amount per point.
