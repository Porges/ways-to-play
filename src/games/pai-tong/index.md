<span class="noun" lang="th-Latn">Pai Tong</span> (<span
lang="th">ไพ่ตอง</span>, ‘<span lang="th-Latn">tong</span> cards’) is a
draw-and-discard card game from Thailand, played with Thai money cards. It is
also known as <span class="noun" lang="th-Latn">Pai Phong Thai</span> (<span
lang="th">ไพ่ผ่องไทย</span>) or <span class="noun" lang="th-Latn">Pai
Chot</span> (<span lang="th">ไพ่จอด</span>).[@ThaiGambling p. 71–6]

Very similar games are also played in Kelantan in Malaysia.

### Equipment

The game is played with six or seven people and uses two full decks of
money-suited cards (120 cards total, four copies of each card). Any style of
card will work.

In Thailand playing cards are produced by government monopoly, so all decks are
the same.

### Setup & Play

Shuffle the cards, and deal six cards to all players, then a second round of six
cards to the starting player and five cards to all others, so that the starting
player has 12 cards and the rest 11.

The first player starts the game by discarding any card. Play proceeds with the
next player in an anti-clockwise direction.

On a player’s turn they draw one card, and then — unless they have won the
game by completing their hand — they discard one. 

The goal of the game is to form a complete hand of 12 tiles, comprising four
sets of three. A set is called a **<span lang="th-Latn">tong</span>** (<span
lang="th">ตอง</span>), and comprises three cards of the same rank.{%fn%}This
term is also used in other card games to describe a triplet.{%endfn%} For the
purposes of forming sets, all the honour cards are considered to be of the same
rank, so a set can be made of three different honour cards.

Instead of taking from the draw pile, a player may also take the previous
player’s discard, if they can form a <span lang="th-Latn">tong</span> using it.
The cards forming the <span lang="th-Latn">tong</span> must be placed face-up on
the table, and then the player makes a discard as usual.
 
If a player only requires one card to win, they may take the winning card from
*any* player’s discard to complete their hand. If multiple players try to claim
the same card to win, the next one in seating order takes it. To complete the
hand and go out is called <span lang="th-Latn">kin</span> (<span
lang="th">กิน</span>, meaning ‘to eat’).

### Scoring

The Thai game seems to have multiple scoring combinations and I have not yet been
able to find or get a good translation for them.

## Pong

The game is also played in Malaysia under the name <span class="noun"
lang="ms">Pong</span>. In @GamblingGamesOfMalaya [p. 137–8] it is described as
being played with Mahjong tiles, but I think it is probably also played with {%a
ceki%}. According to the book, it is played in the state of
[Kelantan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelantan), which is adjacent to
Thailand.

In Malaysia it is only played with four players.

To play with Mahjong tiles, use 120 tiles: all of the suited (circle, bamboo,
character) tiles, as well as the honour (“dragon”) tiles, but no winds or
flowers.

To deal, build them into four walls of 30 tiles (15 long × 2 high), then draw
the tiles one at a time from the wall in a clockwise direction, as in Mahjong.

Play and win as in the Thai game.

A set of three identical cards or tiles is called a <span lang="ms">tong</span>,
a set of three mixed tiles is called a <span lang="ms">tong serong</span>
(“crooked <span lang="ms">tong</span>”).

The winning player scores 2 points + 1 point for each pure <span
lang="ms">tong</span> they have in their hand. Thus, the scores range from only
2 points for a hand containing four <span lang="ms">tong serong</span>, up to 6
points for a hand containing four <span lang="ms">tong</span>. Payment may be
collected from the other players on the basis of some fixed amount per point.
