Need to move this to a new article, maybe Sheded since that seems to be the most active ‘version’ on the internet:

Called in Geʽez[@ComparativeGeez p. 253] <span lang="gez">(አል)ሕዝል</span> <span
lang="gez-Latn">(ʾəl)ḥəzl</span>, <span lang="gez">ኅዝል</span> <span
lang="gez-Latn">ḫəzl</span>. In Amharic it is called <span lang="am">ጣብ</span>
<span lang="am-Latn">ṭab</span> (the name of the casting pieces used), or <span
lang="am">አምባራስ</span> <span lang="am-Latn">ambaras</span>
‘fortress-top’.[@AmharicEnglish2 p. 1126] But this game uses 6 or 7 sticks?.
Also called <span lang="am">አርጴ</span> <span
lang="am-Latn">arəppe</span>,[@AmharicEnglish2 p. 1160] or <span
lang="am">አርቤ</span> <span lang="am-Latn">arəbe</span> (Amharic Silte lexicon).
In Tigrinya it is called <span lang="ti">ሸደድ</span> <span
lang="ti-Latn">sheded</span> and often played by a couple after their wedding.

> There is also ‘Sheded’ and this one is an extremely loved one. The game is
> played with six or more sticks and it is a truth or dare game. All of the
> people involved in the game take turn to flip the sticks and catch as many as
> possible. If one is not able to catch as much as the decided number, the best
> man, wedges the player’s left hand between the sticks and asks for questions
> or dares. He keeps baffling the poor left hand until the truth is told, or the
> dare executed.

The plant used is <cite>Calpurnia aurea</cite>: http://apps.worldagroforestry.org/downloads/Publications/PDFS/B10462.pdf

In Silʼte it is <span lang="stv">እሮብ</span> (Amharic Silte lexicon).
