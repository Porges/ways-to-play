<p class="lead"><span class="noun" lang="haw">Kōnane</span> (sometimes also called <span
lang="haw">mū</span>, which is also used to refer to draughts) is a traditional
Hawaiian abstract game for two players. While it looks similar to checkers at
first glance, the object of the game is different, and the strategy is very
deep.</p>

## History

{% pronounce lang="haw" noun=true word="Kōnane" pronouncer="vawahine"
file="pronunciation_haw_kōnane.mp3" %} stands alone as a purely-abstract game in
Hawaiian culture.{%fn%}John F. G. Stokes (1875–1960, an Australian archæologist
on <span class="noun" lang="haw">Hawaiʻi</span>) suggested at one point—with
only a sliver of linguistic evidence—that <span class="noun"
lang="haw">Kōnane</span> could be a distant descendant of Go, which had been
transmitted by the survivors of Japanese shipwrecks.[@Stokes]{%endfn%}  However,
it definitely existed before European contact, as it was described by Captain
Cook’s voyage, which was the first of its kind to reach the islands (see below).

The game dates at least from the early 18th century, as it was played by Kahekili <span class="rnum">II</span> (c. 1737–1794), who was high chief (<Pronounce lang="haw"  pronouncer="lilibet">aliʻi nui</Pronounce>) of Maui. Kahekili and his advisers possibly used the board, or at least the pieces, to plan battles:

> [T]here was no other king so genuinely accomplished in making war as King
> Kahekili of Maui and the actions on the battlefield plainly showed his
> knowledge of the checkers game of war. […] It was also said that at the house
> of Kahekili the heaps of little stones were maneuvered for battle strategy so
> that his generals need only fulfill their movements.[@KamehamehaAndHisWarrior
> p. 41]

> Not only were [the old <span lang="haw">kāhuna</span> of this land] seers, but
> some of them used the <span lang="haw">papa kōnane hoʻoneʻe ʻiliʻili</span>
> [<span lang="haw">kōnane</span> stones] to guide them in understanding the
> movements on the battlefield.[@KamehamehaAndHisWarrior p. 123]

The gods were also rumoured to enjoy <span lang="haw">kōnane</span>: the volcano
goddess <span class="noun" lang="haw">Pele</span> was said to play it at her home in <span class="noun"
lang="haw">Hale-maʻumaʻu</span> crater.[@Ellis17 p. 183]

The earliest written record we have of the game is from James King,{%fn%}At the
time of the entry quoted, Captain Cook himself had been killed. James King
completed the official account of the voyage upon returning to England.{%endfn%}
who was an officer that sailed on board Captain Cook’s third voyage to the
Pacific.  In an entry dated March 1779, he wrote:

> It is very remarkable, that the people of theſe iſlands are great gamblers.
> They have a game very much like our draughts; but, if one may judge from the
> number of ſquares, it is much more intricate. The board is about two feet
> long, and it is divided into two hundred and thirty-eight ſquares, of which
> there are fourteen in a row, and they make uſe of black and white pebbles,
> which they move from ſquare to ſquare.[@VoyageToPacific p. 144]

Another early witness was Archibald Campbell,{%fn%}Campbell arrived in <span class="noun"
lang="haw">Hawaiʻi</span> aboard the <em>Neva</em>, the first Russian ship to
circumnavigate the world, on the 29th of January 1809, and left aboard the
<em>Duke of Portland</em>, a whaler, on the 4th of March 1810. The <em>Duke of
Portland</em> also carried a letter from King Kamehameha to King George III, see
@Hackler86. More information about the ships is available in
@Jackson92.{%endfn%} a Scottish sailor who visited Oʻahu from
1809–1810. In his book, he described the game:

> They have a game somewhat resembling draughts, but more complicated. It is
> played upon a board about twenty-two inches by fourteen, painted black, with
> white spots, on which the men are placed; these consist of black and white
> pebbles, eighteen upon each side, and the game is won by the capture of the
> adversary’s pieces.
> 
> Tamaahmaah [King Kamehameha I, rumoured to be the son of Kahekili II] excels
> at this game. I have seen him sit for hours playing with his chiefs, giving an
> occasional smile, but without uttering a word. I could not play, but William
> Moxely [Campbell’s interpreter], who understood it well, told me that he had
> seen none who could beat the king.
>
> The game of draughts is now introduced, and the natives play it uncommonly
> well.[@AVoyageRoundTheWorld p. 145]

The area around where Kamehameha lived was called Kou, and was famous as being a
location for playing <span lang="haw">kōnane</span>.[@LegendsOfHonolulu p. 8] A
large stone <span lang="haw">kōnane</span> board{%fn%}@LegendsOfHonolulu
indicates that the site of the large stone board was the “Spreckels Building”,
which was on Fort Street between Merchant St and Queen St, and that the smaller
boards mentioned were near <span class="noun" lang="haw">Kekūanāoʻa</span>’s house, which was
on the corner of King and Richards Streets.{%endfn%} was reported to be opposite
the temple (marked “Hale o Lono” in the map below), in the current location of
the Hawaii Community Foundation. Smaller boards were near what is now Iolani
Palace.

bordered by the yam field at the top. Archibald Campbell stayed for some time
with Isaac Davis, who lived in the rightmost of the three houses on the left.

The game continued to be popular throughout the 19th century; William Brigham
(first director of Hawaii’s state museum) reported that King <span class="noun"
lang="haw">Kalākaua</span> (1836–1891) and his wife Queen <span class="noun"
lang="haw">Kapiʻolani</span> (1834–1899) were “experts at konane”.[@Brigham08 p.
378]

In current times, it is a popular game during the <span class="noun" lang="haw">Makahiki</span> (new year)
festival.[@MolokaiDispatch]

## Equipment

### The Board

The board (<span lang="haw">papakōnane</span> or <span lang="haw">papamū</span>)
is a square or rectangular grid of pits (<span lang="haw">lua</span>).
Traditionally, boards were carved out of wood and raised slightly off the ground
for ease of play, or were made by scraping holes into a slab of volcanic rock.
Games could also be played on the squares of a woven <span
lang="haw">lauhala</span> mat.[@Emory24 p. 85]

Stone boards{%fn%}Peter Faris’ ‘Rock Art Blog’ has [pictures of several stone
boards](https://rockartblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/hawaiian-rock-art-konane-game-boards.html).{%endfn%}
can be found all over the islands of Hawaii, whereas traditional wooden boards
are now hard to find, and are mostly restricted to museums.{%fn%}An image of a
traditional carved board from <span class="noun" lang="haw">Iolani</span>
Palace can be seen in [this Hawaiʻi Magazine
article](https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/content/see-iolani-palaces-hidden-relics-once-belonged-hawaiian-royalty).
In November 2017, an antique wooden board with shell inlay [sold at
auction](https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=6105340&amp;lid=1)
for €150 000.{%endfn%} Wooden boards sometimes had a human molar inset in the
central hole (<span lang="haw">piko</span>, ‘navel’), or in some cases in all
the holes of the board.[@PeterBuck]

Historical board sizes vary greatly, and there is no standard size. King’s
account implies a board of 14×17 squares, while Campbell’s account implies a 6×6
board. An archæological survey on the island of Lanai[@Emory24 p. 84] found 14
boards, with sizes ranging from 8×8 to 13×20.{%fn%}The complete list of sizes
found by Emory’s team was: 8×8, 8×11, 8×13, 9×10 (2 boards), 9×13 (2), 10×10,
11×11, 11×13, 13×13, 13×15, 13×20, and 15×15.{%endfn%} Peter Buck shows two
12×15 boards{%fn%}One of the boards shown by Peter Buck is also shown by
Culin.[@CulinHawaiian]{%endfn%} from the Bishop Museum.[@PeterBuck]

Peter Buck also describes another board in the Bishop Museum which has 10 rows
that alternate in length between 6 &amp; 7 holes.[@PeterBuck] This seems to be
the same board described by Emory, where the pits are set
quincuncially.[@Emory24 p. 84] This is probably not a board for playing <span
lang="haw">kōnane</span>, but for playing a game similar to <span
lang="es">damas</span> (‘Spanish draughts’), which is known in Hawaii as <span
lang="haw">mū</span>. However, it could also be used to play <span
lang="haw">kōnane</span> by playing the game on the diagonal.

### The Pieces

The game is played with black &amp; white pebbles (<span
lang="haw">ʻiliʻili</span>); often the black pieces (<span lang="haw">ʻiliʻili
ʻeloʻelo</span>) were basalt and the white pieces (<span lang="haw">ʻiliʻili
keʻokeʻo</span> or <span lang="haw">kea</span>) made of branch coral.[@Ellis17
p. 159] One <span lang="haw">wahi pana</span> (celebrated location) for stones
was Kōloa,{%fn%}<span class="noun" lang="haw">Kōloa</span> was also famous for its
reproducing stones (<span lang="haw">ʻiliʻili hānau</span>). For more about
these, see @ClarkBeaches or @MajesticKau.{%endfn%} a beach situated between
Nīnole and Punaluʻu in Kaʻū on Hawaiʻi.[@Ellis17 p. 258] Unfortunately most of
this beach has been stripped of its stones for (unrelated) commercial
purposes.[@ClarkBeaches p. 62] 

### Acquiring a set

Commercially produced boards are readily available in Hawaii or online. They are
often wooden, with black &amp; white glass pieces. You could also play the game
on a beach, using rocks &amp; shells.

## Play

The board is set up by filling it with black and white pieces in a checkerboard pattern.

To begin, the first player removes a piece from the centre of the board (or one
of the squares adjacent to that, on an even-sized board), or from any corner.
The second player removes a piece adjacent to the first, and play commences with
each player moving the pieces of the colour that they removed.

On their turn, a player must move a single piece by jumping it over an
orthogonally-adjacent enemy piece into an empty hole, thereby capturing the
enemy piece and removing it from the board. A piece may also make multiple
captures in the same direction by jumping multiple times – this is called <span
lang="haw">kāholo</span>, ‘to move quickly’.

The first player that cannot move any piece on their turn loses; draws are not
possible.
