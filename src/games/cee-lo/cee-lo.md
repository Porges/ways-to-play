# Cee-Lo

<span class="aka">Cee-Lo</span> is a gambling game of Chinese origin played with three dice. It is popular as a street gambling game in the United States.

The English name is apparently derived from the Chinese phrase <span lang="zh">四五六</span> (‘four five six’; Mandarin: <Pronounce lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin"  pronouncer="MarvinMeow" file="pronunciation_zh_四五六.mp3">sì wǔ liù</Pronounce>, Cantonese: <Pronounce lang="yue-Latn-jyutping"  pronouncer="CantoneseSpokenHK" file="pronunciation_yue_四五六.mp3">si³ ng⁵ luk⁶</Pronounce>, Hokkien: <span lang="nan-Latn">sì gō͘ la̍k</span>, Shanghainese: <span lang="wuu-Latn" class="aka">⁵sy ⁶ng ⁸loq</span>),[^fn0]  which is the highest roll in the game. Some books refer to it as “<span class="aka">Strung Flowers</span>”, another Chinese name for the highest roll;[@Bell vol. 1, p. 145] others call it “<span class="aka">Four Five Six</span>”, “<span class="aka">See Low</span>”,[@DiceGamesFrey p. 51] or simply the “<span class="aka">Three-Dice Game</span>”.[@ScarneOnDice p. 345]

[^fn0]: In New York’s Chinatown the Shanghai restaurant “Say Eng Look”[@Frommers95 110] at one point existed (5 East Broadway) across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Square">the square</a> from another Shanghai restaurant named “4–5–6”.[@AChinatownFind] The grandson of the owner of the latter now owns <a href="http://www.456shanghai.com/">a different 4–5–6 restaurant</a> in Mott Street.[@456NextGeneration]

In @GamblingGamesOfMalaya [p. 96] the name is given as <span lang="zh" class="aka">六骰</span> (literally ‘six dice’), but with the odd pronunciation “Luk Kow” (the correct Hokkien pronunciation is <span lang="nan-Latn">la̍k tâu</span>). Cee-Lo is also played with _three_, not six dice. It is possible that the name should be <span lang="zh" class="aka">六九</span> (Hokkien: <Pronounce lang="nan-Latn"  pronouncer="690518207" class="aka" file="pronunciation_nan_69.mp3">la̍k káu</Pronounce>, ‘six nine’); indeed, the game is referred to under the name “<span class="aka">Luk Kow 69</span>” in Brunei gambling law.[@LawsOfBrunei p. 21] I don’t know to what part of the game “69” could refer, but one idea could be the roll <Dice type="chinese">6</Dice>–<Dice type="chinese">54</Dice> read as six–nine.

In @ChineseGamesOfChance [p. 78], the name is given as <span lang="zh" class="aka">候六</span>[@ChineseGamesOfChance 79] ‘watching six’ (Cantonese: <span class="aka" lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">hau⁶ luk⁶</span>), which is the name of one of the winning dice rolls.

In Japan the game is called <span lang="ja" class="aka">チンチロ(リン)</span> <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn"  pronouncer="skent" class="aka" file="pronunciation_ja_チンチロリン.mp3">chin&shy;chi&shy;ro&shy;(rin)</Pronounce>, an onomatopœia based on the noise of dice being dropped into a bowl.[^fn1] It is also played with differing payoffs for each dice outcome (see <span lang="ja-Latn">Chinchirorin</span> below).

[^fn1]: It is also the noise made by the pine cricket (<span lang="ja">松虫</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">matsu&shy;mushi</span>).

As of 2022, the game remains explicitly illegal (under the name “<span class="aka">Luk Kow</span>”) in Malaysia[@MalaysiaCommonGamingHousesAct 29] and Brunei,[@LawsOfBrunei 21] and as “<span class="aka">See Goh Lak</span>” in Singapore.[@SingaporeGamesOfChanceAndSkill]

It is possible the game is derived from a Ming-era game called <span lang="zh-Hant" class="aka">鬭腰</span>/<span lang="zh-Hans" class="aka">鬥腰</span> (Mandarin: <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" class="aka">Dòu Yāo</span>) ‘fighting for the purse’, where the way to make a ‘point’ was the same.[@BettingOnEmpire p. 42] This game is described by <span class="noun" lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">Pān Zhīhéng</span> in his work about dice games @LiuboPu, but I have not yet been able to translate this. At the very least the special throws <Dice type="chinese">456</Dice> and <Dice type="chinese">123</Dice> are mentioned in this work.

## Play

Three dice are required to play. Each time a roll is made, all three dice are rolled. In Chinese and Japanese play, it is usual for the dice to be tossed into a bowl. In the USA they are normally cast against a wall or other vertical surface.

A **point** is a result of a pair along with any other non-matching number, the non-pair number being the value of the point. For example, the roll <Dice type="chinese">225</Dice> would establish a point of <Dice type="chinese">5</Dice>.

### The Banking Game

The traditional method of play is as follows.

One player at a time acts as the banker (<span lang="zh">莊</span>, Cantonese: <Pronounce lang="yue-Latn-jyutping"  pronouncer="robertlam88" file="pronunciation_yue_莊.mp3">zong¹</Pronounce>, Hokkien: <Pronounce lang="nan-Latn"  file="pronunciation_nan_莊.mp3" pronouncer="FlyingBlank">chong</Pronounce>, Mandarin: <Pronounce  lang="cmn-Latn"  pronouncer="Eflong" file="pronunciation_zh_莊.mp3">zhuāng</Pronounce>).

The banker first puts up their stake. Each player in turn then has a chance to _cover_ or _fade_ the banker’s bet, by placing a stake equivalent to some portion of the banker’s bet. The stake that each player places is how much they stand to win or lose on this round. Once the banker’s bet is matched, or each player has had a turn to place a stake, the banker takes back any remaining uncovered bet, and begins the round. Players who did not place any stake will not play in this round.

The banker starts the round by rolling the dice: if they roll the special combination <Dice type="chinese">456</Dice>, any triple, or a point of <Dice type="chinese">6</Dice>, they win the round instantly, and collect their bet and all other player’s stakes.

If the banker rolls the special combination <Dice type="chinese">123</Dice> or a point of <Dice type="chinese">1</Dice>, they lose instantly, and each other player collects their stake and the equivalent amount from the banker’s bet.

If they roll any point other than <Dice type="chinese">1</Dice> or <Dice type="chinese">6</Dice>, that establishes the point value for the round that the other players must roll to beat.

Any other roll that is not one of the rolls mentioned above does not count and must be rerolled until one of the given rolls is made.

The following table summarizes the results for the banker:

If the banker establishes a point of 2–5, each other player in turn rolls the dice
until they roll a result that counts. If it is higher than the banker’s point,
they win and take back their stake and a matching amount from the banker’s bet;
if lower, they lose their stake. If they equal the banker’s point it is a _push_
and the player takes back only their stake.

There are various methods for rotating the banker:

- If any player beats the banker with a triple or <Dice type="chinese">456</Dice> then they will
become the banker for the next round.
- If _any_ player beats the banker, then the bankership rotates for the next
  round.[@GamblingGamesOfMalaya p. 96]
- If _all_ players beat the banker, then the bankership rotates.

## Variants

### <span lang="ja-Latn">Chinchirorin</span> (<span lang="ja">チンチロリン</span>)

The Japanese version of the game is played with a banker, but the payoff depends
on the roll; players can win or lose up to 3× the amount they staked. The
ranking of some rolls also differs from Cee-Lo (e.g. <Dice type="japanese">111</Dice> loses).

Each player has three attempts to “make” their roll by achieving one of the specified outcomes. If they fail then they **bust** and lose their stake. A player also busts instantly if any of their dice escape the bowl — this is called ‘pissing’ (<span lang="ja">小便</span> <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn" pronouncer="smine" file="pronunciation_ja_小便.mp3">shōben</Pronounce>, also used to describe the breaking of a contract).

A triplet is called a ‘storm’ (<span lang="ja">嵐</span> <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_嵐.mp3" pronouncer="straycat88">arashi</Pronounce>).[^source]

[^source]: Apparently this term comes from the game [<span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Oicho-Kabu</span>](games/three-card-game/three-card-game.md#oicho-kabu).

The game is featured in many titles of the
[<cite>Suikoden</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suikoden) series.

#### <span class="aka">Underground <span lang="ja-Latn">Chinchirorin</span></span>

This version of the game is played in the manga/anime series [<cite>Kaiji: Against All Rules</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiji:_Against_All_Rules) (2011).  The payoffs are again different, with <Dice type="japanese">111</Dice> becoming the highest roll.

There are several variations to the main rules:

- The banker has no automatic wins; the players always have a chance to equal or beat their roll. Whoever has the higher roll wins the amount according to their ‘outcome’ in the table below.
- Each player is banker for two rounds. If on their first round the banker rolls a <Dice type="japanese">111</Dice>, busts, or rolls a <Dice type="japanese">123</Dice> then they pass on the bankership after the first round. A player can also pass on the bankership instead of taking it.
