<p class="lead">Chuck-A-Luck was a simple dicing game popular in the United States in the mid to
late 19th century and early 20th century. It began as a portable soldier’s game
and later developed into more complex casino variants.</p>

## Sweat-Cloth / Chuck-A-Luck

### Play

{% imageEnd %}

The play of the game is simple: there is a staking-board with six cells
containing the numbers 1 through 6. Each player places their bet(s) on numbers
of their choosing. The dealer or house rolls three dice and players whose
numbers show up on the dice win. Bets on numbers that do not match any of the
dice are won by the dealer.

Winning bets are paid at 1× the stake for each die that matches the number (so,
a maximum of 3× if all three dice match).

These usual payouts lead to a relatively high house edge of 7.87%, and thus
Chuck-A-Luck has an earned reputation of being a “suckers” game. In more modern
casino variants the payout for all three dice matching is usually increased to
make the game more attractive: a 5× payout still leads to a house edge of 6.94%,
and even a 12× payout{%fn%}As used in the New Zealand variant of Sic
Bo.{%endfn%} retains a house edge of 3.7%, higher than that of roulette.

{% imageEnd %}

A game known as Sweat-Cloth{%fn%}Probably in this context meaning a canvas
saddle-cloth, upon which numbers were written to serve as a staking
layout.{%endfn%} was played since at least the early 19th century. The name
could also be shortened to simply “Sweat”.[@TheAmericanHoyle4 p. 480] Gambling
histories often cite an English origin, but I have yet to find any early mention
of the game there.{%fn%}Although there are old English slang terms for gaming
cloths, such as “tatty tog” from <i>tatt</i> dice and <i>tog</i>
clothes[@ADictionaryOfTheSlangAndCantLanguages] (American derivatives of these
sources note that this is equivalent to “sweat-cloth”[@Vocabulum p. 89]), I have
yet to find reference to an actual game that is played with these
cloths.{%endfn%} The earliest reference I have found so far dates from 1808,
when a man was indicted in Pennsylvania because he:[@IndictmentsAndPleas p. 442]

> … unlawfully did publicly and privately set up, erect, make, exercise, keep
> open, show and expose to be played at, drawn at and thrown at by dice, numbers
> and figures, a certain play and device called sweat-cloth

Another early reference to the equipment used in the game dates from 1810:

> A Nicholas Creerly, has, in a Bucks county (Penn.) paper, in the uſual way,
> warned the public not to truſt his wife on his account, charging her with
> having deſtroyed his property, &c. His wife, in reply to this notice, ſays:
> “That he need not have taken this pains, as no perſon where he is known, will
> truſt her to the amount of a ſingle cent on <em>his</em> account, and as for
> bed and board, he never had any for her—and aſks how ſhe could deſtroy his
> property, when he never had any, except three <em>dice</em>, a
> <em>sweat-cloth</em>, and a <em>rum bottle</em>.”[@MarylandGazetteFeb141810]

Other references from the 19th century show that in the United States the game
was commonly played as a side-attraction at horse racing
events:[@TheChiefOfHisTribe][@TheCamdenRaceCourse]

> What is a race-course but a convention of gambling hells out of doors, where,
> in a wider net, more of the weak and the vain are caught at the faro-bank or
> sweat-cloth, or induced in the excitement to bet on the
> horses?[@GamesOfChanceAsAmusement]

By 1830, the game began to be called Chuck-A-Luck (or simply Chuck-Luck), and
this is the name that stuck. It was commonly played by soldiers and by the late
19th century was known as the “old soldier’s game”.{%fn%}This term is also used
for Housie or Bingo.{%endfn%}

{% imageEnd %}

By the 1870s, the game also began to be manufactured with images instead of pips
on the dice, and in this form it was called Mustang or Horse-Head (with dice
with images of a horse’s head, anchor, and the card suit symbols: club, spade,
diamond, and heart). In another form it was known as Feather and Anchor
(horse-head, anchor, feather, game cock, leaf, star).[@WanderingsofaVagabond p.
238][@ATourOfStLouis p. 532] Yet another form had the symbols: snake, elephant,
eagle, baby, turtle (and 6th?).[@FoolsOfFortuneOrGamblingAndGamblers p. 283]

It is possible that it was one  one of these pictorial versions that was taken
and adopted by the British as {% gameref crown-and-anchor %}.

The came was also transmuted into a horse-racing form, played using dice with
sides marked {% cards 'PACERS' %}. Under the name “Cubic Mutual Pool”, this was
played as early as 1888.[@CubicMutualPool]

## Casino Chuck-A-Luck / Grand Hazard

{% imageEnd %}

In casinos the basic game was augmented with equipment to become known as either
“Hyronemus” (where the dice were spun in a bowl) or “Bird-Cage” (where the dice
were tumbled inside a wire hourglass).

Many books of the time claim that these tools were often gaffed or crooked, with
one advertisement for an Electric Hyronemus claiming it can be made to roll only
“Treys and Fours” on command.

### Extended Bets

The basic 1–6 betting game was also extended to incorporate other types of bets.
This version of the game could also be called Grand Hazard (despite its name,
this has nothing to do with the earlier game of Hazard). These kinds of bets are
still used in modern games run under the name of Chuck-A-Luck.

In addition to the “Chuck” bets, which are played in boxes labelled 1–6 as
usual, the extended staking layout contains boxes for the following bets:

<dl>
<dt>Raffles</dt>
<dd>
<p>A “raffle” is a three-of-a-kind. There are two different raffles bets that can be made: either that any raffle will come up, which pays 29:1{%fn%}Note that the payments on the board in the image below are given as “30 <em>for</em> 1” and not “30 <em>to</em> 1”. This means that the stake counts as part of the winnings and thus increases the already-high house edge.{%endfn%} (fair odds 35:1), or else a bet can be placed on a specific raffle, which pays 179:1 (fair odds 216:1). Both bets have the same high house edge of 16.67% and so in the long-term are equivalent bets.</p>
<p>More modern versions of the game might pay out 30:1 for any 3-of-a-kind, which has a slightly lower edge of 13.89%.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Low (≤10) or High (≥11)</dt>
<dd>These bets are on what the total number of pips showing on the dice will be. Both would be even bets except that they lose on a raffle. They have the same odds and pay 1:1 (fair 37:35); the house edge is the lowest on the board at 2.78%.</dd>
<dt>Specific totals</dt>
<dd>
    <p>Each total is paid out at a different rate. All have extremely high house edges:</p>

### Other Hyronemus Bets

{% image

    license="cc0" %}
A Hyronemus layout, from @GamblingAndGamblingDevices [p. 117].
{% imageEnd %}

Some bets seen on Hyronemus layouts are based on the sum of the dice:

<dl>
<dt>Low (&lt;10) and High (&gt;11)</dt>
<dd>Both of these are bad bets, paying 1:1 (fair odds 1⅔:1) for a house edge of 25%.</dd>
<dt>10 &middot; 11</dt>
<dd>Both of these are worse bets, paying 4:1 (fair odds 7:1) for a house edge of 37.5%!</dd>
</dl>

### Field Bets

Other versions of the game include “field” bets, which are a bet that the dice
pip total will be one of a range of numbers. These bets always pay 1:1.

Examples include:

<dl>
<dt>5 &middot; 6 &middot; 7 &middot; 8 / 13 &middot; 14 &middot; 15 &middot; 16</dt>
<dd>This field has a house edge of 3.7%.</dd>
<dt>3 &middot; 4 &middot; 5 &middot; 6 &middot; 7 / 13 &middot; 14 &middot; 15 &middot; 16 &middot; 17 &middot; 18</dt>
<dd>Despite having more numbers, this field excludes the common ‘8’, and has a house edge of 15.74%.</dd>
</dl>

There are also two-dice fields, where two of the three dice are coloured
differently to the third, and the field value is based upon their total:

<dl>
<dt>2 &middot; 3 &middot; 4 &middot; 9 &middot; 10 &middot; 11 &middot; 12</dt>
<dd>As seen on layouts produced by <a href="https://www.icollector.com/Framed-Chuck-a-Luck-Layout-with-Field-Bet-Game-was-pl_i8609509">Taylor & Co.</a> or the <a href="http://museumofgaminghistory.org/mogh.php?p=gallery&d=Gallery/Antique%20Equipment/Hazard/&i=3">K. C. Card Company</a>. The house edge on this field is 11.11%.</dd>
<dt>2 &middot; 3 &middot; 5 &middot; 9 &middot; 10 &middot; 11 &middot; 12</dt>
<dd>As seen on layouts produced by <a href="https://www.icollector.com/Mason-Co-Straight-Chuck-A-Luck-Layout-ca-1900_i8638281">Mason & Co</a>. The house edge on this field is 5.56%.</dd>
</dl>

## Fairground variants

Given the high house edge on all Chuck-A-Luck bets, it wouldn’t seem that any
further advantage would be needed—but gambling operators apparently didn’t think
so. Further developments of the game increased the returns for the operators.

### 3-Spindle Chuck-A-Luck

This version has three separately-rotating spindles, and has exactly the same
odds and house edge as standard Chuck-A-Luck.

    alt="Three overlapping spinners that can point to any one of the numbers 1 to 6."

As found in Kernan Manufacturing’s @KernanCatalogue [p. 26].
{% imageEnd %}

### Spindle Chuck-A-Luck

This version of the game used a single spindle, which is spun, and the numbers
that it lands on are the winners. Since the distribution of the numbers is
different to the distribution given by dice, the house edge is higher than
normal. The manufacturer claimed that it would double the usual take, but in
reality the edge is nearly three times higher, at 21.43%.

If this wasn’t enough, the game was often played with a gaffed wheel that
allowed the operator to stop the spindle spinning at will.

{% imageEnd %}

### Jumbo Dice Wheel (Big Six)

The standard version of this nowadays (at least in the United States) is a
wheel-of-fortune with money printed on it, but in its earliest form the wheel
had dice drawn in each sector. As with Spindle Chuck-A-Luck, the distribution of
the dice rolls has been manipulated to provide the operator extra income. The
house edge on the wheel on the right below, with 48 sectors, is 14.583%. The
edge on the wheel at left, with 54 sectors, is 12.963%.{%fn%}Or at least, it is
intended to be. The wheel represented here seems to have an error where one 5
has been switched with a 3, so the edge on those two numbers is different.
(Scarne[@ScarneGambling pp. 501–3] miscalculates the house edge on this wheel as
22.22%, as it seems has was working from a different version than shown in the
photo in his book.){%endfn%}

In general the more doubles or triples on the wheel, the worse the odds are for
the players.
