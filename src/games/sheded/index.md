This is a game from Ethiopia and Eritrea which involves throwing six or more
two-sided sticks, that each have one side marked. Depending on how many marked
sides come up, the player may undergo a truth-or-dare style ‘punishment’.

I have found little information about this game outside of dictionaries, and any
more information about this game would be greatly appreciated!

The two sides of the throwing-sticks are called (in Amharic) the <span lang="am">ንጉሥ</span> <span lang="am-Latn">nəguś</span> ‘king’ and <span lang="am">ራስ</span> <span lang="am-Latn">ras</span> ‘head’ (=duke),[@AmharicEnglish2 p. 2142] and the sticks are often made from the wood of [<cite>Calpurnia aurea</cite>.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calpurnia_aurea)[@UsefulTreesAndShrubsInEritrea p. 112]

In Geʽez the game is called <span lang="gez" class="aka">(አል)ሕዝል</span> <span lang="gez-Latn" class="aka">(ʾəl)ḥəzl</span>, <span lang="gez" class="aka">ኅዝል</span> <span lang="gez-Latn" class="aka">ḫəzl</span>.[@ComparativeGeez p. 253]

In Amharic it is called <span lang="am" class="aka">ጣብ</span> <span lang="am-Latn">ṭab</span>[@ComparativeGeez p. 253] (the name of the casting pieces used),[@AmharicEnglish2 p. 2142] or <span lang="am">አምባ፡ራስ</span> <span lang="am-Latn">amba-ras</span> ‘fortress-top’.[@AmharicEnglish2 p. 1127] Other names are <span lang="am">አርጴ</span> <span lang="am-Latn">arəppe</span>[@AmharicEnglish2 p.  1160] or <span lang="am">አርቤ</span> <span lang="am-Latn">arəbe</span>.[@SilteAmharicDictionary p. 179]

In Silʼte it is <span lang="stv" class="aka">እሮብ</span>[@SilteAmharicDictionary p. 179] (<span lang="stv-Latn">irobi</span>??).

In Tigrinya it is called <span lang="ti" class="aka">ሸደድ</span> <span
lang="ti-Latn">sheded</span> and often played by a couple after their wedding.
This version seems to have the most references online, for example:

> There is also ‘Sheded’ and this one is an extremely loved one. The game is
> played with six or more sticks and it is a truth or dare game. All of the
> people involved in the game take turn to flip the sticks and catch as many as
> possible. If one is not able to catch as much as the decided number, the best
> man, wedges the player’s left hand between the sticks and asks for questions
> or dares. He keeps baffling the poor left hand until the truth is told, or the
> dare executed.[@WhatHappensAfterTheWedding]
