<span lang="jav-Latn" class="noun">Sampèn</span> is a simple skill-free gambling
game played in Java using [Ceki](/articles/cards/ceki/)
cards.[@JavaanseKaartspelen p. 56–7] It is also described as being played in
China.[@CardGamesAroundTheWorld p. 5]

<!-- excerpt -->

## Equipment

The game is played by at least five players with a single Ceki deck of 60 cards,
containing two copies of each card.

It can also be played by combining two decks of standard playing cards: from
each deck, take the {%cards 'A–10' %} in {%cards 'shd' %} as well as the {%cards 'JQKc' %}, giving two
copies of each card, and 60 cards total.[@CardGamesAroundTheWorld p. 4–5]

## Play

Deal five cards to each player, then the dealer places the remainder of the deck
face-down in the middle as stock.

Players first discard any identical pairs they have from their hands.

To begin the game, dealer turns up the top card of the stock. Any player
with an identical matching card may play it to the middle, and then throw out
any other card from their hand. Any player who has the matching card for this
discard may then take a turn similarly.

Once a card is turned up or thrown out that no player can match, the dealer
turns up the next card from the stock.

The first player to run out of cards (which will be by matching their last card,
without throwing another out) wins the round.

## Payments

The game is played for money in the <span lang="jav-Latn">wudhon tengah</span>
(‘middle bet’) fashion: at the start of each round, every player places the same
stake in a central pot, and whoever wins the round takes the whole thing.

However, the winner must shuffle the cards and deal the cards for next time
(including turning up cards from the stock).

## Variants

In @CardGamesAroundTheWorld, Sid Sackson suggests dealing a varying number of
cards depending on the number of players:
