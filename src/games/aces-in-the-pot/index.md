<p class="lead">Ace(s) in the Pot is a simple gambling game which requires no skill and two dice.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

The earliest mention I have found of this game is in the 1885 edition of
@TheAmericanHoyle13 [p. 467].

<!-- @TheCompleteBookOfGames [p. 351]. Later descriptions of this game[@Bell p. 130]
all seem to stem from this one source.  -->

## Play

The game can be played by any number of players, who sit in a circle.

Each player begins the game with two tokens. The goal of the game (although the
players cannot influence the outcome) is to win the pot by being the last player
with a token.

On each playerâ€™s turn they make one roll of both dice. For each {%dice 1%}
thrown, they place one token in the pot. For each {%dice 6%} thrown, they pass
a token to the next player on their left. Then they pass the dice to the next player.

Play continues around the circle. Any players left without tokens drop out of
the game and do not participate further.

Once there is only one token that is not in the pot, its owner makes three
rolls. If they make three rolls without rolling any {%dice 6%}, they win the
game. Otherwise, they pass the dice and token to the next player, who proceeds
with their attempt.
