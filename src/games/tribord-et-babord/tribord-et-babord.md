Port’) is a 19th-century dice gambling game for two players.</p>

{/* excerpt */}

## Equipment

<Pronounce noun="true" lang="fr" file="pronunciation_fr_tribord_et_bâbord.mp3" pronouncer="Pat91">Tribord et Bâbord</Pronounce> is played using a board and a single die, and six tokens to mark the spaces on the board. The board contains six symbols, which are also printed on the die. These are similar to those used in the game of [Crown & Anchor](games/crown-and-anchor/crown-and-anchor.md).

The game was published by the <span class="noun" lang="fr">L. Saussine</span> company of Paris in 1880 (printed by <span class="noun" lang="fr">Roche</span> and illustrated by one <span class="noun" lang="fr">B. Coudert</span>).[@BibliographieDeLaFrance69 p. 227]

## Play

The following rules are derived from @TableauxEtCartons.

Before play begins, the players decide on the amount of money that each stake is
worth (or the game can be played for points), and also who is to play as <span
lang="fr">Tribord</span> (‘starboard’) and who is to be <span
lang="fr">Bâbord</span> (‘port’).

On a player’s turn, they have three attempts at rolling the die.

Each time they roll one of their own symbols, they mark it with a token. A
symbol can only be marked off once.

The first time a player marks off one of their symbols, their opponent pays them
1× the stake, the second time (called {%pronounce lang="fr" word="radoub"
pronouncer="marois" %}, ‘refitting’ the ship), they are paid 2×, and the third
time (called the <Pronounce lang="fr"  pronouncer="spl0uf">prise</Pronounce>,
‘capture’), they win 4× the stake.

If they roll a symbol that is already marked off, they are paid 1× the stake.

Each time they roll one of their opponent’s symbols, they pay them 1× the stake
(this is called the <Pronounce lang="fr"  pronouncer="spl0uf">écueil</Pronounce>,
‘reef’).

If a player doesn’t manage to roll a single one of their own symbols in their
three attempts, this is called <span lang="fr">naufrage</span> (‘shipwreck’),
and they must pay their opponent 3× the stake in addition to any payments
already made.

The rules supplied above do not state when the game ends, but a straightforward
method would be to end it as soon as one player has completed the <span
lang="fr">prise</span> by marking off all the symbols on their side.

[Crown & Anchor](games/crown-and-anchor/crown-and-anchor.md) uses a similar board, and was perhaps the inspiration for this game.
