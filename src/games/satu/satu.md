# <span lang="tpi" class="noun">Satu</span>

The game of <span lang="kew" class="aka noun">Satu</span> (amongst the Muli Ekerepa),[@WaitingForCompany p. 207] or <span lang="mbw" class="aka noun">Sandu</span> (amongst the Maring),[@IsGamblingBisnis p. 47] is a simple gambling game that was played with dice in Papua New Guinea in the 1980s. As of 2010, the game has apparently fallen out of fashion.[@BambooFire, in afterword]

## Play

Three dice are needed to play. The player rolls all three dice: if the majority of dice show one of <Dice>123</Dice>, then the result is ‘one’ (Kewa <span lang="kew">pameda</span>); if most show <Dice>456</Dice> then the result is ‘four’ (Kewa <span lang="kew">maala</span>).[^fn0]

[^fn0]: Oddly this seems to use numbers originating from two different counting systems, see @KewaCounting.

Bets are either on ‘one’ or ‘four’. A player chooses their target at the start of the session and does not change. They only choose which dice rolls to bet on, and who to bet against: bets are placed and settled between individuals, although most players will form an implicit ‘team’ that they are coöperating with.[@WaitingForCompany 208]

Players do not usually bet against members of their own clan, but instead competitions are held between villages. If one player wins big they are expected to stay until the end of the game to give other players the chance to even the score.[@KeepingEqual 11–2]
