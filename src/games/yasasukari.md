<span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Yasakukari</span> (<span lang="ja">八道行成</span>, also pronounced <span lang="ja-Latn">yasugari</span> or <span lang="ja-Latn">yasukari</span>) is an old board game, played in Japan, of the Fox and Geese family.[@KoreanGames p. 77]

{%aside%}It was possibly played China as well, but I have not been able to find any more information about this yet.{%endaside%}

The game is named in the book <cite>[Wamyō Ruijushō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wamy%C5%8D_Ruijush%C5%8D)</cite> (<span lang="ja">倭名類聚抄</span>, ‘Japanese names, classified and annotated’), published in 938, so it was played in Japan since at least the <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Heian</span> period. The name of the game also appears in the fifth-century [<cite>Mahāparinirvāṇa sūtra</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%81y%C4%81na_Mah%C4%81parinirv%C4%81%E1%B9%87a_S%C5%ABtra), where it is described as a game to avoid,[@Lusthaus p. 205]{%fn%}For other games that the Buddha says to avoid, see @EarliestKnownList.{/* https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=linebyline&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=true&script=latin */}{%endfn%} but it is possible that this might not refer to the same game.

## Play

The description below is mostly based upon @Yasukaki.

Diagram of the initial setup, from the [<cite lang="ja-Latn">Wakan Sansai
Zue</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakan_Sansai_Zue) (<cite lang="ja">和漢三才図会</cite>,
 ‘Illustrated Sino-Japanese Encyclopedia’), first published in 1712.

One player has the single piece which starts in the centre, the other player has
the 16 pieces that start on the intersections around the border.

The player with the single piece starts the game.

On each player’s turn they may move one of their pieces to any empty adjacent
intersection. If the single piece moves to an intersection directly between two
other pieces, it captures both of them.

The player with multiple pieces wins by surrounding the single piece so that it
cannot move. The single piece player wins by reducing the number of other pieces
so that they are no longer able to surround it.

The game {% gameref sixteen-soldiers %} is probably a later version of this
game.
