<p class="lead"><span class="aka">Assault</span> is a traditional board game for two players that used to be popular throughout Europe. In English it is commonly known by the Spanish name <span lang="es" class="aka">Asalto</span>.</p>

Assault was probably derived from the game of [Fox & Geese](games/fox-and-geese.md), with which it shares a board. The play of the game is similar, but the object in Assault is for one side to achieve a particular arrangement of their pieces — although it is still possible to win by “trapping” like in [Fox & Geese](games/fox-and-geese.md).

The presentation of the game usually has a militaristic theme, often celebrating some recent engagement.

## Setup 

> [!figure]
>
> ```yaml
> src="asalto_board.svg" noborder=true alt=""
> ```
>
> The board for Assault. The fortress is marked in red.

The game is played on a board with 33 points arranged in a cross shape. Nine points on one arm of the cross are marked off to form the **fortress**.

> [!figure]
>
> ```yaml
> src="asalto_setup.svg" noborder=true alt=""
> ```
>
> The initial setup for Assault. The attacker’s pieces are purple and the defender’s are yellow.

The two players are called the **attacker** and the **defender**.

The attacking player starts with twenty-four pieces, which are placed on each intersection outside the fortress. The defender starts with two pieces, which either begin the game on the points indicated in the diagram, or may be placed upon any points within the fortress (this differs by ruleset).

## Play

The attacker starts and may move any of their pieces from its location to another empty location along one of the lines. The attacker’s pieces must always be moved towards the fortress, and in particular may never be moved sideways except at the very top of the two horizontal arms (these forbidden moves are the dashed lines in the diagram above; in printed sets the forbidden lines are often in a different colour).

The defender’s pieces move in a similar way, but are not required to move in any particular direction. They may also **jump** over an attacker’s piece in a straight line to a vacant point beyond it, as in checkers. This captures the jumped piece and removes it from the board. A defending piece may make multiple jumps in a single turn, and may change direction after each jump. The defender *must* make a jump if it is possible, and cannot jump one of their own pieces.

> [!figure]
>
> ```yaml
> src="defender_multiple_jumps.svg" noborder=true alt=""
> ```
>
> A defending piece may make multiple consecutive jumps.

The goal of the attacker is to occupy every point of the fortress, or to surround their defender’s pieces so that they cannot move. The goal of the defender is to reduce the attacker to eight pieces so that they cannot achieve their goal. The first player to achieve their goal wins.

## Variants

### Alternate Boards

Many small variations of the board have been published. Some are displayed here.  For these I do not have rules, so it is unclear if horizontal movements were permitted or not.

### <span class="aka">Royal Garrison</span>

The game has also been played with a larger board. In Germany this variant was called <span lang="de" class="aka">Grosses Festungs-Spiel</span> (‘large fortress game’). In the United States the game was patented in 1915 by one Helmuth Dueberg.[@HelmuthDueberg] Milton Bradley later published this game under the name “<span class="aka">Three Guardsmen</span>”, and later as “<span class="aka">Bataan: The Battle of the Philippines</span>” (1943) and “<span class="aka">Three Musketeers</span>” (1950). In Canada it was published as “<span class="aka">Yellow Peril</span>” by Somerville board games.[@FreedomToPlay p. 20] In England it was called “Royal Garrison” (published by John Jaques & Son),[@DrawingRoomPlays p. 274] “Siege” (J. W. Spear & Sons), or “<span class="aka">Hungarian Tactics</span>” (Ogilvy). It has also been published as “<span class="aka">Fortification</span>” and “<span class="aka">Transvaal</span>”.[@WarGamesHistory]

The defender has three pieces which start on the middle and either end of the
bottom row of the fortress. The attacker has fifty pieces which are placed on
all points outside the fortress. Play is otherwise the same as Assault.
