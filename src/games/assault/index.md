<p class="lead">Assault is a traditional board game for two players that used to be popular
throughout Europe. In English it is commonly known by the Spanish name <span lang="es">Asalto</span>, but it originally comes from Germany.</p>

It is played on the same kind of board as {% gameref fox-and-geese %} or {%
gameref solitaire %}, but is usually marked to indicate the areas of the board.

## Setup 

{% image src="asalto_board.svg" alt="" %}
The board for Assault. The fortress is marked in red.
{% imageEnd %}

The game is played on a board with 33 points arranged in a cross shape. Nine
points on one arm of the cross are marked off to form the **fortress**.

{% image src="asalto_setup.svg" alt="" %}
The initial setup for Assault. The attacker’s pieces are purple and the defender’s are yellow.
{% imageEnd %}

The two players are called the **attacker** and the **defender**.

The attacking player starts with twenty-four pieces, which are placed on each
intersection outside the fortress. The defender starts with two pieces, which
either begin the game on the points indicated in the diagram, or may be placed
upon any points within the fortress (this differs by ruleset).

## Play

The attacker starts and may move any of their pieces from its location to
another empty location along one of the lines. The attacker’s pieces must always
be moved towards the fortress, and in particular may never be moved sideways
except at the very top of the two horizontal arms (these forbidden moves are the
dashed lines in the diagram above; in printed sets the forbidden lines are often
in a different colour).

The defender’s pieces move in a similar way, but may also jump over an
attacker’s piece in a straight line to a vacant point beyond it, as in checkers.
This captures the jumped piece and removes it from the board. A defending piece
may make mutiple jumps in a single turn, and may change direction after each
jump. The defender must make a jump if it is possible, and cannot jump one of
their own pieces.

{% image src="defender_multiple_jumps.svg" alt="" %}
A defending piece may make multiple consecutive jumps.
{%imageEnd%}

The goal of the attacker is to occupy every point of the fortress, or to
surround their defender’s pieces so that they cannot move. The goal of the
defender is to reduce the attacker to eight pieces so that they cannot achieve
their goal.

## Variants

### Alternate boards

Many small variations of the board have been published. Some are displayed here.
For these I do not have rules, so it is unclear if horizontal movements were
permitted or not.
