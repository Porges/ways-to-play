<span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Tehonbiki</span> (<span lang="ja">手本引き
</span>, meaning something like ‘draw an example’) is a traditional Japanese
gambling game.

It is usually played with three special sets of cards:

* Cards for each player, numbered 1–6. These are called <span
  lang="ja-Latn">harifuda</span> (<span lang="ja">張札</span>), <span
  lang="ja-Latn">kakifuda</span> (<span lang="ja">書札</span>), or <span
  lang="ja-Latn">dai ichi roku</span> (<span lang="ja">大一六</span>). There are
  two styles; the Ōsaka style has the odd numbers in red, whereas with the Kyotō
  style all the numbers are black.
* Cards for the dealer, again numbered 1–6, but in a different pattern. These
  are called <span lang="ja-Latn">kurifuda</span> (<span lang="ja">繰札</span>
  ‘shuffling cards’), {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn" word="oyafuda"
  file="pronunciation_ja_親札.mp3" pronouncer="cochan0308" %} (<span lang="ja">
   親札</span> ‘house cards’), <span lang="ja-Latn">hikifuda</span> (<span
  lang="ja">引札</span> ‘drawing cards’), or <span
  lang="ja-Latn">mamefuda</span> (<span lang="ja">豆札</span> ‘bean cards’). The
  card with the number 4 on it is usually stamped with the manufacturer’s mark.
* Wooden blocks numbered 1–6 for the dealer to show recently chosen numbers.
  These are called <span lang="ja-Latn">mefuda</span> (<span lang="ja">目札
  </span> ‘seeing cards’), <span lang="ja-Latn">memoku</span> (<span lang="ja">
  目木</span> ‘seeing woods’), or {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn" word="meyasufuda"
  file="pronunciation_ja_目安札.mp3" pronouncer="cochan0308" %} (<span
  lang="ja">目安札</span> ‘easy-to-see cards’).

The 1968 Japanese film <cite>Red Peony Gambler</cite> <ruby lang="ja">緋牡丹<rt
lang="ja-Latn">hibotan</rt>博徒<rt lang="ja-Latn">bakuto</rt></ruby> (also
titled in English ‘Lady Yakuza: The Red Peony Gambler’) opens with a scene in
which the game is played. (The film can be viewed [on The Internet
Archive](https://archive.org/details/LadyYakuzaTheRedPeonyGambler).) 

See @FinalMahjong for examples of the use of <span lang="ja">通り</span>.

## Equipment variations

When played with [Mah Jong](/equipment/mah-jong.html) tiles, it is called <ruby
lang="ja">牌本引<rt lang="ja-Latn">haihonbiki</rt></ruby>.

Tehonbiki can also be played with [Hanafuda](/equipment/hanafuda.html) cards. In
this case it is called <ruby lang="ja">絵本引<rt
lang="ja-Latn">ehonbiki</rt></ruby>. When used in this manner, the values of the
cards are ignored and only the months are considered; the mapping of months to
numbers is:

1. Pine (January) or bush clover (July)
2. Rain (November) or silver grass (August)
3. Cherry (March) or chrysanthemum (September)
4. Wisteria (April) or maple (October)
5. Iris (May) or peony (June)
6. Paulownia (December) or plum (February)

When playing with Hanafuda, the ‘eyes’ (mefuda TODO) are not used, and
instead the past outcomes are recorded on a piece of paper.

Tehonbiki can also be played with dice (TODO).
