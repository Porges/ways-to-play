## Play

One player controls a single larger piece which is placed upon the central
intersection of the board. The other player starts with 16 pieces placed on each
 of the intersections around the border.

On each player’s turn they must move any of their pieces along a line from its
intersection to an adjacent empty intersection. If the large single piece moves
onto the intersection directly between two other pieces, those pieces are
captured and removed from the board.

The goal of the player with the smaller pieces is to surround the single piece
so that it cannot move, thus winning the game. The goal of the single piece is
to eliminate enough opposing pieces that it cannot be surrounded.
