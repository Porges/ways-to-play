## Play

One player controls a single larger piece which is placed upon the central
intersection of the board. The other player starts with 16 pieces placed on each
 of the intersections around the border.

The board has 31 intersections on it. On each player’s turn they must move any
of their pieces along a line from its intersection to an adjacent empty
intersection. If the large single piece moves onto the intersection directly
between two other pieces, those pieces are captured and removed from the board.

The goal of the player with the smaller pieces is to surround the single piece
so that it cannot move, thus winning the game. The goal of the single piece is
to eliminate enough opposing pieces that it cannot be surrounded.

## Sixteen Pursue the General

In China the game is called “Sixteen pursue the general” (<span lang="zh" class="aka">十六趕將軍</span>, Mandarin: <Pronounce lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin"  class="aka" file="pronunciation_zh_十六趕將軍.mp3" pronouncer="j10oyc24e">Shí liù gǎn jiāng jūn</Pronounce>, Cantonese: <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping" class="aka">sap⁶ luk⁶ gon² zoeng¹ gwan¹</span>).[@Himly p.  469][@CulinChess p. 874][^fn0]

[^fn0]: In older works this is transliterated <span lang="yue-Latn" class="aka">Shap luk kong tséung kwan</span> or <span lang="cmn-Latn" class="aka">Šĭ liu kan tsiang kün</span>.

The rules of the game are the same as the Japanese version, but it is played on
a slightly different board, with a different extension and 29 points.

## Water Drowns the Monk

Initial setup of the Sichuan/Tibetan board.

This version, called “Water Drowns the Monk” (<span lang="zh" class="aka">水淹和尚</span>, Mandarin: <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" class="aka">Shuǐ yān héshàng</span>) was reported to be played by shepherds in Sichuan and Tibet (which share a border). The “water” player has 15 pieces and the “monk” player has one. Entering the monk between two water pieces to remove them was termed “carrying water”. The goal of the water player was to drive the monk into the “monastery” extension and pin them there.[@DieFandse p. 168]
