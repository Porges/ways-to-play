## Play

One player is chosen to be the first roller, the other players place their bets, and the roller rolls two dice. The roller loses the best on a dice total of 5 or 9, and wins on 3, 11, or a double.

On any other result, a target number is established, which the other players may place a bet against. This bet (named a <span lang="fr">masse</span> in French) may be accepted and met, or refused by the roller. If accepted, the roller wins the bet by rolling this number again, 3, 11, or a double; if they roll 5 or 9, they lose the bet.
