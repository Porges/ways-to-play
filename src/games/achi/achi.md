<span class="noun aka" lang="ee">Achi</span> is a [mill game](articles/families/mill-games/mill-games.md) from West Africa, reportedly (in the 1920s) played in Ghana. It was also played by Yoruba people in Nigeria, where it was known as <span class="noun aka" lang="yo">Akidada</span>.[@Murray2 p. 43]

The game is very similar to Five Men’s Morris, but an additional form of mill is permitted, compared to the standard game. The game as reported below was recorded by [Kenneth Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Murray_(archaeologist)), son of [H. J. R. Murray](articles/people/hjr-murray.md) and Nigeria’s first surveyor of antiquities.

It is possible that the name should really be transcribed <span lang="ee">adji</span>, the name of a plant ([<cite>Caesalpinia bonduc</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilandina_bonduc)) that has large grey seeds suitable for use as gaming pieces.[@LocalPlantNames] The same name is also used for a mancala game, so the name could be generic for all games played with these seeds.[^1]

## Play

> <span class="noun" lang="ee">Achi</span> is played on the medium-sized mill board.

Each player has six pieces. To begin the game, players take turns placing a single piece on any of the free points. If at any stage a player completes a mill, they can remove and capture any one of their opponent’s pieces.

A valid mill, like in other mill games, consists of three pieces in a straight line. However, in <span class="noun" lang="ee">Achi</span>, a mill may also be formed by *two* pieces on the central lines on either side.

Once a player has placed all their pieces, they then move one piece at a time from a point to any free point, along a line, attempting to form a mill. A player that is reduced to two pieces loses.
