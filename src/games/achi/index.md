<span class="noun" lang="ee">Achi</span> is a <a href="/articles/mill-games/">mill game</a>
from West Africa, reportedly (in the 1920s) played in Ghana and by Yoruba people
in Nigeria, where it is known as <span class="noun" lang="yo">Akidada</span>.[@Murray2 p. 43]

<!-- excerpt -->

The game is very similar to Five Men’s Morris, but an additional form of mill is
permitted, compared to the standard game. The game as reported below was
recorded by [Kenneth
Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Murray_(archaeologist)), son of
[H. J. R. Murray](/articles/people/hjr-murray/) and Nigeria’s first surveyor of
antiquities.

It is possible that the name should really be transcribed <span
lang="ee">adji</span>, the name of a plant ([<cite>Caesalpinia
bonduc</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilandina_bonduc)) that has large
grey seeds suitable for use as gaming pieces.[@LocalPlantNames] The
same name is also used for a mancala game, so the name could be generic for all
games played with these seeds.{%fn%}See also @AdjiBoto.{%endfn%}

## Play
{% image

    alt="" %}
<span class="noun" lang="ee">Achi</span> is played on the medium-sized mill board.
{% imageEnd %}

Each player has six pieces. To begin the game, players take turns placing a
single piece on any of the free points. If at any stage a player completes a
mill, they can remove and capture any one of their opponent’s pieces.

A valid mill, like in other mill games, consists of three pieces in a straight
line. However, in <span class="noun" lang="ee">Achi</span>, a mill may also be formed by
*two* pieces on the central lines on either side.

Two examples of valid mills; the two-piece mill is unique to <span class="noun" lang="ee">Achi</span>.
{% imageEnd %}

Once a player has placed all their pieces, they then move one piece at a time
from a point to any free point, along a line, attempting to form a mill. A
player that is reduced to two pieces loses.
