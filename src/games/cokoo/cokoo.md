<span lang="mnk" class="aka noun">Cokoo</span>[@MandinkaEnglish 12][@IntermediateGambian 23] (also written Chokō,[@AncientCeylon 604] Chukoo, or Chokoo[@ChokooGameVideo]) is a game from The Gambia; the name itself seems to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandinka_language">Mandinkan</a>. 

This game was first described in print in the early 20th century,[@AncientCeylon 604] and it is still played today.[@ChokooGameVideo] Sometimes it has been referred to as “African checkers”,[@LiberianTribes fig. 100] but that name is also used to refer to other games such as those of the [Mancala family](articles/families/mancala-games/mancala-games.md).

## Play

The game is played on a 5×5 grid of 25 holes dug into sand or loose earth. Each player has a set of sticks (<span lang="mnk">kala</span>) which are used as playing pieces by inserting one end into the ground. The sticks do not need to be differentiated from each other as each player places their pieces on a different angle. The sole source for rules of this game does not state how many sticks are to be used, but presumably both players have 12 pieces.

To begin, players take turns placing a stick one at a time, until one player decides to begin the next phase of the game. Usually[@AncientCeylon 604] this occurs when each player has one stick remaining. Any remaining sticks can be placed as a player’s turn at any point later.

For the second phase of the game, each player takes one of their sticks and jumps it orthogonally over an adjacent opponent’s stick into an empty hole, and removes **both** the jumped stick and any other of the opponent’s sticks from the board. The player who first runs out of all of their sticks loses.

It is not stated by the key source, but presumably the players may also move a stick one square orthogonally instead of jumping.

## Similar games

[Yoote](games/yoote/yoote.md)  is a very similar game from neighbouring Senegal, which lacks the “dropping” phase of Chokoo. [Sīja](games/sija/sija.md) is also very similar but capture is by enclosure rather than jumping. [Kōnane](games/konane/konane.md) also has similar gameplay.

General references: the game is also re-described in @Murray2 [§4.4.5, p. 83], but I think Murray misinterprets the description of the game.
