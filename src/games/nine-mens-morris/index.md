<p class="lead">
Nine Men’s Morris is an ancient {%a mill-games,mill game %}
dating at least from Roman times. It is the most prominent of all the mill
games, played all around the world, but particularly in central European
countries. Other variations of the game — such as {% gameref shax %} or {%
gameref morabaraba %} — are also played in several African countries.
</p>

In addition to being a game, the board itself was used as some kind of talisman
or symbol; @MerylsBoardEnigma [p. 330] collects nearly a thousand examples of
inscribed mill boards from around the world. Many of these are in vertical
positions on walls where they could not possibly have been used for games, and
their purpose is at the moment not well understood.

The game (as most mill games) is split into two phases. During the first
(placement) phase, the players take turns placing a single piece at a time onto
one of the vacant points on the board. Once all the pieces have been placed, the
movement phase begins. In this part of the game, players take turns moving a
single piece along a line to another vacant point. Once a player is reduced to
three pieces, their pieces can ‘fly’ and move to any empty point on the board. 

Throughout the game, each time a player forms a mill they remove any piece of
their opponent’s that is not part of a mill. If all their opponent’s pieces are
in mills, no piece may be removed.

During the movement phase, it is possible to form two mills simultaneously. In
this case the player may remove two of the opponent’s pieces from the board.

A player loses the game when they are reduced to fewer than three pieces, or if
they are unable to make a valid move on their turn.

When played on a board with diagonals, mills are not usually permitted to be made on the diagonal lines. However, this varies according to location and time.

The game dates from at least the late Roman Empire or Byzantine period, and at
the moment we do not have solid evidence for an earlier
date.[@GamesGreekAndRoman p. 3]{%fn%}@RamatHanadiv [p. 227] describes a board
found in a Byzantine villa in <span lang="he">חורבת עקב</span> (<span class="noun"
lang="he-Latn">Ḥorvat ʿAqav</span>), dated 400–600&nbsp;{%ce%}, while a cache of
gaming boards found in a Roman fort at <span class="noun" lang="ar-Latn">Abu Sha’ar</span>
that was abandoned in the late 4th century contained no mills
boards.[@RomanGameBoards]{%endfn%} Earlier dates have often been proposed based
upon the existence of boards carved on ancient monuments such as the
Ramesseum[@AncientEgyptiansAtPlay p. 144] and the Mortuary Temple of Seti I at
Qurna,[@AncientCeylon p. 644] but these are not able to be dated
definitively—the monument only provides an <em>earliest possible</em>
date.{%fn%}This is also discussed at length in @SchadlerMisconceptions.{%endfn%}

The game became popular throughout Europe: a double-sided game board with a Nine
Men’s Morris layout on one side was found as part of the  [Gokstad Viking ship
burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gokstad_ship) (<abbr
title="circa">c.</abbr> 900) which was discovered in
Norway.[@TheVikingShipFromGokstad pp. 44, 99] Another boat burial (the “<span class="noun"
lang="sv">Årby</span> boat”) from around the same time also included a Morris
game.[@BoardGamesInBoatBurials p. 441]

One of the earliest written references to the game is in the 10th century [<cite lang="ar-Latn">Kitāb al-Aghānī</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitab_al-Aghani) (<cite lang="ar">{% isolate "كتاب الأغاني" %}</cite>, ‘book of songs’), a large collection of poems and stories assembled by [<span class="noun" lang="ar-Latn">ʾAbū l-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Faraj_al-Isfahani) (<span lang="ar">{% isolate "أبو الفرج الأصفهاني" %}</span>, 897–967). One story describes a club from the time of the poet <span class="noun" lang="ar-Latn">al-Aḥwaṣ</span> (<span lang="ar">{% isolate "الأحوص" %}</span>, 660–724), along with the board games it held for the use of its members.  According to the book, they could play <span lang="ar-Latn">shiṭranj</span> (<span lang="ar">{% isolate "شطرنج" %}</span>, chess), <span lang="ar-Latn">nard</span> (<span lang="ar">نرد</span>), or — most importantly here — <span lang="ar-Latn">qirq</span> (<span lang="ar">{% isolate 'قرق' %}</span>, morris).[@GamblingInIslam p. 481] The derivation of the name <span lang="ar-Latn">qirq</span> (<span lang="ar">قِرْقٌ</span>) is uncertain,{%fn%}It may also be related to the Geʽez word <span lang="gez">ቀርቂስ</span>[@LexiconLinguaeAethiopicae pp. 424–5] (<span lang="gez-Latn">qarqis</span>), referring to various games,[@ComparativeGeez p. 443] or the (Ottoman) Turkish <span lang="ota">قرق</span>/<span lang="tr">kırk</span> ‘forty (=many)’.[@DictionnaireTurcFrançais2 p. 989]{%endfn%} but it is apparently not originally an Arabic word.[@Murray2 p. 37]{%fn%}The Imam <span class="noun" lang="ar-Latn">ʾAbū al-Qāsim al-Rāfiʿī al-Qazwīnī</span> (<span lang="ar">{% isolate "أبو القاسم الرافعي القزويني" %}</span>, 1160–1226) would later describe <span lang="ar-Latn">qirq</span> as the “chess of the [Maghrebis”.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghrebis)[@GamblingInIslam p. 381] Similarly, {% gameref shax %} is sometimes referred to as “Somali chess”.{%endfn%}

Later, <span class="noun" lang="fa-Latn">Faīrūzābādī</span> (of whom, more below) would
identify <span lang="ar-Latn">qirq</span> with <span
lang="ar-Latn">suddar</span> (<span lang="ar">سُدَّر</span>), apparently derived
from the Persian <span lang="fa-Latn">se darre</span> (<span lang="fa">سِهْ
دَرَهْ</span>), meaning ‘three valleys’.[@Hyde2 pp. 207–9] However, in other
dictionaries <span lang="ar-Latn">suddar</span> is identified with other games
such as <span lang="ar-Latn">aṭ-ṭabanu</span> (<span
lang="ar">الطَّبَنُ</span>), which is known as a different game today (modern
name <span lang="ar-Latn">aṭ-ṭāb</span> <span lang="ar">الطاب</span>).[@LaneTab]
It is probable that in the past, names of games were more fluid, and often
referred to families of games. Even in modern Arabic the name <span
lang="ar-Latn">ʾidrīs</span> (<span lang="ar">ادريس</span>) is used to refer to
mill games, but also refers to loosely related games such as
[Quantik](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/286295/quantik). With that said, a
Persian origin for the game does seem likely, given the number of ways that
<span lang="ar-Latn">suddar</span> is rendered in Arabic
dictionaries.{%fn%}Other versions of the name are given as <span lang="ar">سِهْ
بَرَهٌ</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">sih barahun</span>), <span
lang="ar">سِيدَرَهِ</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">sīdarahi</span>), <span
lang="ar">سِدْرَه</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">sidrah</span>), <span
lang="ar">سَذْ مَرَهْ</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">saḏ marah</span>), or <span
lang="ar">سِدْ مَزْه</span> (<span lang="ar-Latn">sid
mazh</span>).[@LaneTab]{%endfn%}

From the Arabic-speaking world the game entered Spain, where <span
lang="ar-Latn">al-qirq</span> became <span lang="es">alquerque</span>, which has
remained the Spanish name for this family of games until the present day.

In France the game was in the past called <span lang="fr">marelles</span> (from
which we get the English ‘merels’), probably deriving from a word meaning “small
stone” or “token”.{%fn%}The <span lang="fr">marelles</span> name currently
refers to hopscotch, due to the stones tossed upon the diagram.{%endfn%}

{% imageEnd %}

In the early 12th century, the game was
mentioned in the French Rule of the Templar order (probably written between 1139
and 1147 {%ce%}[@TheRuleOfTheTemplars p. 12]), as the only board game allowed
to be played by Templar brothers. It is possible that the order picked up the
game through their contact with the Arabic-speaking world:{%fn%}Indeed, a board
has been found inscribed upon a stone in [<span class="noun" lang="fr">Château
Pèrelin</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_P%C3%A8lerin), a
fortress constructed by the Templars in what is now Israel — although it could
have been placed there any time since the fortress was built.[@AtlitCastle p.
60]{%endfn%}

<div class="multi">

<span lang="fr">Et sachies que a nul autre jeu frere dou Temple ne doit joer,
fors qu’a marelles as queles chascun puet juer se il veaut por desduit sans
metre gajeures. As eschas ni a tables nul frere dou Temple ne doit juer, ne as
eschaçons.[@LaRegleDuTemple p. 185]</span>

And let it be known that a brother of the Temple should play no other game
except <span lang="fr">marelles</span>, which each may play if he wishes, for
pleasure without placing wagers. No brother should play chess, backgammon, or
<span lang="fr">eschaçons</span> [an unknown game].[@TheRuleOfTheTemplars p. 90]

</div>

It is unclear <em>why</em> mill games were permitted by the
Templars<!--{%fn%}TODO: it has been suggested (?) that the tripartite board was
taken as supportive of the trinity, or remniscent of the First Temple of
Jerusalem.{%endfn%}-->, but, reading the rest of the passage (not quoted above),
the intent of the Rule seems to be to prevent playing games for money — bets
were allowed to be placed on games, but only with worthless items such as wooden
tent pegs. Viewed in this light, perhaps mill games were considered less
susceptible to gambling, and therefore permissible.

In 1283 it appeared in the Castilian king [Alfonso
X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_X_of_Castile)’s <cite lang="es">Libro
de los Juegos</cite> (<cite>Book of Games</cite>), where in addition to the
standard game, rules for playing with dice are given ([see below](#with-dice)).

In the same century the <cite lang="la">Bonus Socius</cite> series of
manuscripts contained problems for the game, alongside other problems for chess
and various table games.[@Murray p. 619] Chess historian H. J. R. Murray
describes the problems as being of very high quality, and that in fact “they
leave a more favourable impression of the ingenuity of the mediaeval composer
than is the case with the problems of chess or tables.”[@Murray p. 703]

By examining depictions of the game in artwork, we can understand the attitude
towards the game at the time the image was produced. In the manuscript image
below (<abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 1340), nobles of opposite sex face each
other across a game board. Evidently the game was considered worthy of being
played by the nobility, and suitable for men and women to play together:

The previous scene is in stark contrast to this German woodcut by Hans Weiditz
from @Trostspiegel [p. 24] — a version of Petrarch’s <cite>De remediis utriusque
fortunae</cite> published some 200 years later in 1572. In this image we can see
Chess being played by nobles and Backgammon by ordinary men, but Nine Men’s
Morris is evidently only suitable to be played by monkeys:

The board with diagonals seems to appear first in Arabic sources;[@Murray2 p. 43] it is shown — as the only drawing — in the famous <span class="noun" lang="ar-Latn">al-Qamūs al-Muḥīṭ</span> dictionary (<cite lang="ar">القاموس المحيط</cite>, ‘The Surrounding Ocean’) of [<span class="noun" lang="fa-Latn">Fairūzābādī</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairuzabadi) (<span lang="fa">{% isolate 'فیروزآبادی' %}</span>, 1329–1414), published at the start of the 15th century.[@alQamus]

In China the game is mentioned by the Ming Dynasty author <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" class="noun">Xiè Zhàozhè</span> (<span lang="zh" class="noun">谢肇淛</span>, 1567–1624 {%ce%}) in his <cite>Five Assorted Offerings</cite> (<cite lang="zh">五杂组</cite>),[@MerelsChina] and game-boards (almost entirely of the ‘diagonals’ type) have been found in China, starting from boards dated to the the 8–9th centuries in the [Uighur Khaganate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_Khaganate) in what is now Mongolia, to the Balhae kingdom in the 9–10th centuries, and eventually spreading throughout the rest of China through the Liao/Song, then Jin and Yuan dynasties (10–14th centuries). It seems probable that the game reached China through the Silk Roads from the Middle East.[@MerelsChina]

In later English history the game developed an association with rusticity, often mentioned as a game played by shepherds. In such guise it famously appears — albeit relocated in time and place to a fictional ancient Athens — in Shakespeare’s [<cite>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream) (<abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 1595), where, thanks to a feud between Titania and Oberon (queen and king of the fairies), the natural state of the countryside is upended, and:

> The ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,<br/>
> The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn<br/>
> Hath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard.<br/>
> The fold stands empty in the drowned field,<br/>
> And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;<br/>
> **The nine men’s morris is filled up with mud,**<br/>
> And the quaint mazes in the wanton green<br/>
> For lack of tread are undistinguishable.

The game can be seen in English history through its appearance in
[visitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_visitation) records; one
instance from the parish of Bitteswell records that in 1634 a certain Robert
Lord the Younger was “admonished and dismissed” for “plaieing at nine men’s
morrice in the Churchyard on Sundaie”.[@MetropoliticalVisitation p. 497]

In colonial America, the game began to be played with twelve pieces (exclusively
on the board with diagonals) and thus became the standard American form, known
as [Twelve Men’s Morris](#twelve-mens-morris).{%fn%}Rules for a game called
<span lang="es">alquerque de doze</span>, sometimes translated as Twelve Men’s

## Analysis

With perfect play, the game is a draw.[@SolvingMorris][@UltraStrongMorris] Interestingly, it is possible for the starting player to make a losing move as early as their third turn.[@SolvingMorris 112]

## Variants

### Alternate boards

The standard rules can be adapted to play on many different boards. As in
standard Nine Men’s Morris, mills must always be in a straight line and may not
turn corners.

Babbage also apparently experimented with differently-shaped boards, in both
triangular and pentagonal shapes,[@SourcesInRecreationalMathematics] but I have
not yet been able to see the manuscript in question.

Alternate boards of German origin:[@KlassischeSpiele p. 58] a ‘sun-mill’ (played
with 12 pieces each), and two boards constructed from nested pentagons. The
first pentagonal board is played with 11 pieces each, the second is designed to
be played by two or more players: for two players use 12 pieces; for three, 8;
for four, 6; and for five, 5.

coloured board, a mill may not cross between differently-coloured regions, and
the middle point may only be taken to complete a mill or prevent completion of a
mill on the next turn.

### Twelve Men’s Morris

This is played with twelve pieces per player, on a board that has
diagonals.[@Zaslavsky p. 7][@Murray2 p. 48] In all other respects, the game is
the same.

#### Nomenclature

In other countries or languages Twelve Men’s Morris has been known as:

* Bengali: <span lang="bn">বারো গুটি (পাইত পাইত)</span> (<span lang="bn-Latn">bārō-guṭi (pāit-pāit)</span>) ‘twelve bead [unsure]’.[@GuptaD p. 145]
* Sri Lanka (Sinhala): <span lang="si">නෙරෙංචි</span> or <span lang="si">නෙරිංචි</span> (<span lang="si-Latn">nereṁci</span>{%fn%}Also transcribed as <span lang="si-Latn">Nerenchi</span> or <span lang="si-Latn">Niranchy</span>.{%endfn%} or <span lang="si-Latn">neriṁci</span>), possibly named after a plant that has very thorny seeds.[@Zaslavsky p. 16][@SportsAndGamesOfSinghalese p. 34][@AncientCeylon p. 577]
* Urdu: <span lang="ur">بارہ گوٹی</span> (<span lang="ur-Latn">bārā guṭī</span>) ‘twelve pieces’.

### With Dice

  src='Nine_Mens_Morris_with_dice_in_Libro_de_los_juegos.jpg'
  license="cc0" %}
A game being played with dice, from Alfonso X’s <cite>Book of Games</cite>.
{% imageEnd %}

Alfonso X’s book of games describes a variant played with dice.[@AlfonsoGames]
While it is unclear from the manuscript what the exact rules are, Ulrich
Schädler offers the following interpretation:[@NineMensDice]{%fn%}This
interpretation disagrees with previous interpretations given in @Murray2 and
@Bell; see the article for full details.{%endfn%}

1. During the placement phase, no mills may be made.
2. During the movement phase, each player rolls three dice before moving a
   piece. If they roll any of the special rolls {% dice 654 %}, {% dice 633 %}, {%dice 522 %}, or {% dice 411 %}, they may ‘fly’ a piece from anywhere on the board to complete a mill (or two mills). For any other result, the player moves as normal. 


### Lasker Morris

This variant was developed by <span class="noun" lang="de">Emanuel Lasker</span>, who was
World Chess Champion from 1894 to 1921. It unifies the two phases of the game
into one.

Play is as in the standard game, except that each player has 10 pieces instead
of 9, and on a player’s turn they may <em>either</em> place a new piece or move
a piece that is already on the board.

With perfect play the game is a draw.[@SolvingLaskerMorris][@UltraStrongMorris]

## Commerical Variants

### Mozog

{%aside%}
The game was originally patented (US
[4,579,347](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4579347A)) in a slightly
different form, with a more complex board. In this version each player had 14
pieces.

{% image 
    alt=""
    src='mozog.svg' %}
The board from the patent was of a more complex construction, but with fewer squares.
{% imageEnd %}
{%endaside%}

{% image 
  alt=""
  src='mozog-published.svg' %}
The Mozog board as published has 7 nested squares, giving 56 points.
{% imageEnd %}

[Mozog](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22075/mozog) is a variant created in
1984 by Wilhelm Reman, and it is played on a custom board. Each player has 20
pieces, and play is as in Nine Men’s Morris except that mills may not be made
along the dotted lines on the board. The game is over when one player is reduced
to two pieces.

### Trencho

Trencho was a variant published by Chad Valley in 1916 that was billed as “An
Australian War-Game as Played in the Camps & Trenches”.

{% image 
  alt=""
  position="aside"
  src="trencho.svg" %}
Trencho is played on a modified large mill board. The game was published with
(at least) two different configurations.
{% imageEnd %}

Trencho is played on a modified mill board where only two shortened diagonals
are present. Mills are called “trenches”.

The game is played as usual except:

* Upon forming a trench, a player may either remove an opponent’s piece or
  restore one of their own. If they replace a piece it may not complete a
  trench.
* A trench may not be formed again in the same position by the same three
  pieces.
