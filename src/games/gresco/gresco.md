<p class="lead"><span class="aka">Gresco</span> is a very old dice game, dating from at least the 13th century.</p>

In English sources, it is mentioned as early as 1605 in @EastwardHoe [p. 56].{%fn%}Nare claims it as a card game[@NaresGlossary 213] probably based upon its proximity to {%gameref primero%} here, but they are associated by being both gambling games.{%endfn%} In {%a new-academy %} it is described as a card game, but I think this is probably a joke; the character who mentions it says that she knows it only by “hear-say” and lists it alongside “primofistula”!
In Florio’s Italian–English dictionary of 1611{%fn%}It is not mentioned in his earlier dictionary of 1598.[@WorldeOfWordes]{%endfn%} it is definitively mentioned alongside {%gameref hazard%} as a dice game.[@QueenAnnaFlorio 45, 303, 463]

My best guess is that it is the same as the French game <span lang="fr">la Griesche</span>, which is most famously described in several poems by [Rutebeuf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutebeuf) (fl. 1245–85) entitled <cite lang="fr">Li diz de la Griesche d’yver</cite> (<cite>The tale of the Griesche of Winter</cite>), and <cite lang="fr">La Griesche d’estei</cite> (<cite>The Griesche of Summer</cite>)<!--, and <cite lang="fr">Li diz des ribaux de greive</cite>-->.[@CommerceOfTime] Griesche also appears in {%a rabelais,Rabelais’ list of games %}; some scholars [who?] believe that this refers to a game of shuttle-cock (the word has this meaning in Anjou; see @RutebeufComplete [p. 26-8], but I disagree with him identifying blanc=zara=griesche), but a dice game fits the context there more easily.

Other old French names are <span lang="fr" class="aka">le grieske</span> (Arras, 13th century),[@ChansonsEtDits 97] <span lang="fr" class="aka">la grigoise</span> (seen in Jehan de Journi’s <cite lang="fr">La Disme de Penitanche</cite>, 1288) or <span lang="fr" class="aka">la grijoise</span>,{%fn%}I and J were as yet undifferentiated in text so this is written <span lang="fr" class="aka">griioise</span> in the source.{%endfn%} in an undated work entitled <cite lang="fr">Resveries</cite>, with the wonderful lines:[@Disme 163][@JongleursEtTrouveres 40]

<div class="multi">
<p lang="fr">
J’a perdu tout mon argent<br/>
&emsp;A la griioise.<br>
Il i a bone cervoise<br/>
&emsp;En Engleterre.
</p>
<p>
I have lost all my money<br/>
&emsp;At <span lang="fr">grijoise</span>.<br/>
There is good beer<br/>
&emsp;In England.

Et ke nus ne puist juer a hasart ne a le griece ou roiome dengletiere sor le forfait de x libres.

Que nous ne puis jouer à hasard ni à la griesche, au royaume d’Angleterre, sur(?) le forfeit(? no modern French) de dix livres.

Which also says "granche"!

The word can also mean ‘gray’, and is used to refer to several birds (perdrix griesche, grey partridge; pie griesche, wariangle; poule griesche, moor-hen, hen of Greece;<!-- https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1475-1640_a-dictionarie-of-the-fre_cotgrave-randle_1611/page/n499/mode/2up?q=griesche--> griesche, the woodlark) or also means to ‘prick’, as in the name <cite>Ortie Griesche</cite> ‘stinging nettle’ (or Ortie Grecque, greek nettle).<!-- https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1475-1640_a-dictionarie-of-the-fre_cotgrave-randle_1611/page/n675/mode/2up?q=griesche --><!-- https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_C47LbJ2Wo7IC/page/n161/mode/2up?q=griesche --><!-- https://archive.org/details/mobot31753000811155/page/131/mode/2up?q=griesche -->{%fn%}Another place the game seems to appear is [in MS 12483 of the BnF](https://archive.org/details/bub_gal_ark_12148_btv1b8454680s/page/n15/mode/2up?q=griesche), but I cannot locate any further information about the passage in question. @Notice12483 [520] discusses the manuscript in depth but skips over the section in question. @PoemeMoralise [456] reproduces the start of this section only — a poem on the myrtle tree. The best place to look is apparently <cite lang="fr">Les Propriétés des choses selon le “Rosarius”</cite> (1994).{%endfn%}

@LesPoésiesPersonnellesReview [405] discusses Rutebeuf saying that the game “denudes” the players.

Also check for griesche: https://dn790009.ca.archive.org/0/items/leromandefauvel00gervuoft/leromandefauvel00gervuoft.pdf

https://www.persee.fr/search?ta=article&q=griesche

The main meaning was Greek.[@DictionnaireHistorique6 427] The “pricking” meaning seems to have come from nettles.

This in turn is probably the same game as <span lang="es" class="aka">guirguiesca</span>, which is described in [Alfonso X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_X_of_Castile)’s @AlfonsoGames of 1283, where sufficiently-detailed rules are supplied. It possibly earlier appears in <cite lang="es">Ordenamiento de las tafurerias</cite> (1276/7 {%ce%}), a law code regarding gambling games which was also produced upon the command of Alfonso X.[@GreedForGain 1] Here <span lang="es" class="aka">gargista</span> was described as a game which could legally be played for money — as long as other rules were followed. Various manuscripts of this code give 11 different spellings of the name, but none of them the same as <span lang="es" class="aka">guirguiesca</span>.[@GreedForGain 18]{%fn%}The variants are <span lang="es">gargista</span> (most commonly), as well as <span lang="es">gargisca, gargita, gagista, sargista, grigiesca, gargujsca, garguista, gagisca</span>, and <span lang="es">gorgista</span>.[@LibroDeLasTahurerias 342]{%endfn%}

Later Catalan regulations in the following centuries list a banned game under the names <span lang="es" class="aka">grescha</span> (Barcelona, 1296), <span lang="es" class="aka">graescha</span> (Barcelona, 1304), and <span lang="es" class="aka">grahescha</span> (Perpignan, 1425),[@ELJocDeNaibs 187–9][@Perpignan 81] all of which probably refer to the same thing.[@GreedForGain 20]

This: https://archive.org/details/histoirelittra20riveuoft/page/734/mode/2up?q=griesche
says it's the same game as as Blanque/Blanche, Azar/Zara

Blanque, jeu de hazard: https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_VgLHqfZBcwAC/page/102/mode/2up?q=blanque+hazart

Blanque & de jeu de hazard… (regarding the invention of the Tontine) https://archive.org/details/histoireetrecher03sauv/page/n73/mode/2up?q=blanque+hazart

However, this describes blanque as a tavoletta/lotto: https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UzBQAAAAcAAJ/page/158/mode/2up?q=%22jeu+de+blanque%22

This also agrees that it is a lotto: https://archive.org/details/dictionnairetymo00quit/page/144/mode/2up?q=%22jeu+de+blanque%22
