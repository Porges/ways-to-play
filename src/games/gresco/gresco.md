<p class="lead"><span class="aka">Gresco</span> is a very old dice game with unknown rules.</p>

It is mentioned as early as 1605 in @EastwardHoe [56] (alongside {%gameref primero%}).

In {%a new-academy %} it is described as a card game, but I think this is probably a joke; the character who mentions it says that she knows it only by “hear-say” and lists it alongside “primofistula”!

In Florio’s dictionaries it is definitively mentioned alongside Hazard as a dice game.[@QueenAnnaFlorio 45, 303, 463]

My best guess is that it is the same as the French game <span lang="fr">la Griesche</span>, which is most famously described in a poem by [Rutebeuf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutebeuf) which is variously titled either <cite lang="fr">La Griesche d’Esté</cite> or <cite lang="fr">La Griesche d’Hiver</cite> (‘Griesche of Summer’/‘… Winter’). Griesche also appears in {%a rabelais%} list of games; some scholars [who?] believe that this refers to a game of shuttle-cock (the word has this meaning in Anjou), but a dice game fits the context there more easily.
