> In the previous Issue 2 feature, titled “Punning, Punters and Bankers”, Chap Ji Ki was reported to have begun in the early 20th century. Writer Baba Tan Kuning has since uncovered records to show that the gambling began more specifically in the early 1930s due in no small way to a confluence of factors. The Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, managed by KTM (Keretapi Tanah Melayu), started operating in 1932 around the same time when Chap Ji Ki betting was legalised by the Sultan of Johor. Bookies and punters in Singapore could board the KTM train daily and head for the gambling dens of Johor Baru to place their bets. Chap Ji Ki thus became an overnight craze in Singapore.
