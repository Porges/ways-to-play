Probably actually <span lang="bo-Latn">Khang-gsar</span>; the game is said to
represent a conflict between the <span lang="bo-Latn">Khang-gsar</span> (<span
lang="bo">ཁང་གསར</span>) and <span lang="bo-Latn">Ma-zur</span> (<span
lang="bo">མ་ཟུར</span>) families from the region of Hor, and the
monks.[@GamesOfTheTibetans]

[Güshi Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCshi_Khan) invaded this region
under the direction of the [5th Dalai
Lama,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Dalai_Lama) thus establishing control
for the Gelug (<span lang="bo">དགེ་ལུགས་པ</span>) school.

The game may represent this.
