Crown & Anchor is a dice game that is probably most famous as being popular with
British and “Colonial” servicemen in the early 20th century, but today it is
played in many locations around the world. The game play is equivalent to that
of {% gameref chuck-a-luck %}, but the pips on the dice and the numbers on
the staking-table are replaced by symbols: the titular 👑&#xfe0e; crown and
⚓&#xfe0e; anchor, and the playing-card suits: {% cards 's' %} spade,
{% cards 'c' %} club, {% cards 'd' %} diamond, and {% cards 'h' %} heart.

## History

<blockquote class="blockquote epigraph">

‘It’s a fair game,’ he was saying; ‘it’s a fair game. The wee boy has the same
chance as the old man, and the old man as the wee boy.’[@ItsAFineWorld p. 210] 

</blockquote>

Please note that the following is (necessarily, for me) biased toward
English-language sources. It is entirely possible the game has a longer history
elsewhere; for the moment, at least, I cannot say.

Many gaming histories cite a 17th or 18th century origin for the game, but based
on textual evidence it seems to date from the late 19th century (at least in the
version played with the Crown and Anchor symbols), possibly derived from
pictorial versions of Chuck-A-Luck such as “Mustang”. In England there are
certainly many old references to “dice boards” or “gaming tables”, but they are
not described in detail very often.

At first, the game was played with symbols other than the crown and anchor. The
earliest reference I have found is to a version played with “anchors, stars,
clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds” at the coronation fair of George IV in Hyde
Park in 1821.{%fn%}This is clearly the same game as six outcomes are listed
and the operator announces “three to win, three to lose” — a classically
misleading claim!{%endfn%}[@DissolutionOfCoronationFair]

Other variants were developed through the 19th century: In 1842, the
<cite>Punch</cite> character Mr. Muff “mistrust[s] the chances of the ‘Dimunt,
Star, Hanker, Crown, Club, and Feather’” being played at the (fictional)
“Clodpole races”.[@CuriositiesOfMedicalExperience] In 1859 a game involving
“anchor, heart, etc” is described at a fair,[@GamblingAtFairs] and in 1860
“clubs, spades, &c.” at a game at the races.[@GamblingAtTheRaces] An 1864
newspaper article claims that [Deacon
Brodie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Brodie) played a game of “anchor,
club, star, feather, heart, [and] spade” in his youth, but this may be
anachronistic — in any case, it is still an early
reference.[@TheMysteriesOfEdinburgh] In 1875 there is reference to a game of
“feather, star, and anchor” being played in Epping
Forest.[@EasterMondayInTheForest] In 1889, chuck-a-luck (as the “three dice
game”) is reported in
[Middlesbrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough).[@GamblingInMiddlesbrough]

Early references to the game under the name <span lang="nl">anker en zon</span>
(“anchor and sun”) appear in Flanders in 1880,[@Aldenardiana] and finally as
“the crown and anchor game” in Melbourne, Australia in
1882.[@CrownAndAnchorAustralia]{%fn%} The game under the name of {% gameref
chuck-a-luck %} or “old sweat” is known in Melbourne from at least
1866.[@LayOfAMelbourneVagrant]{%endfn%} An equivalent game is recorded as being
played in British-controlled Hong Kong in 1884.[@HongKongCrownAnchor]

Information from the people who actually ran the games is hard to find. One
notable exception is that of Arthur Harding, whose memoir details his life
growing up in [The
Nichol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_Estate),{%fn%}The Nichol was a
slum in East London, also called the “Jago”, which was torn down in the
1890s.{%endfn%} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[@EastEndUnderworld]
Harding states that “some of the first pennies [he] earned was holding up the
boards for ‘Crown and Anchor’”, and describes how the board would be held by a
person at each end, with a cloth on which the staking layout was painted placed
on top. The entire setup was designed to make it as easy as possible to
disappear when the police arrived, although in many cases the games were
tolerated by police as the income the games provided prevented the operators
from resorting to harder crimes.{%fn%}Such as “snide-pitching” (passing false
money), and “shoot-flying” (stealing pocket watches by grabbing their
chains)!{%endfn%}[@EastEndUnderworld pp. 175–8]

{%aside%}
Another curious patent for a game using Crown & Anchor dice was filed in 1891[@PatentLudoCrownAnchor] and eventually granted in modified form in 1905;[@PatentLudoCrownAnchor2] this one combined the dice with the game of Ludo, but is mechanically unrelated.
{%endaside%}

An interesting patent lodged in England in 1895 (see image) indicates that the
crown-and-anchor version of the game must have been known at that time, but I
have yet to find any other references to it this early on, and the patent does
not mention Crown & Anchor by name.[@GB189504141A]

The game has also at times been called “bubble and buck”,[@BubbleBuck1911]
“bumble and buck”,[@APrivateInTheGuards" p. 189] “diddlum
buck”[@SmallerSlangDictionary p. 44]  or “toodlum buck(s)”.{%fn%}This name was
also used in Australia to refer to a children’s game played with a teetotum;
perhaps the version on sale here is Crown & Anchor played with a
teetotum.{%endfn%}[@ToodlumBucks]

### Boer War

The game seems to have first became popular with British soldiers during the
[Second Boer War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War) (1899–1902),
when British and Australian troops fought alongside American volunteers. It was
possibly transmitted from American troops at this time. [Sir Bertram Fox
Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertram_Fox_Hayes) describes the game being
played aboard his ship,{%fn%}The SS
[<cite>Britannic</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Britannic_(1874)).{%endfn%}
while transporting troops to South Africa.[@HullDown p. 103]  In 1900, the game
is recorded as having been played by English <abbr class="initialism"
title="prisoners of war">POW</abbr>s at the
[Waterval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterval) prison camp, under both the
names of “chuck-a-luck”[@AGlimpseAtWaterval] and “crown and
anchor”.[@TrooperMilverton] British soldiers’ diaries also record the game being
played in military camps at [De
Aar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Aar)[@AutobiographyOfAMilitaryGreatCoat p.
391] and on transport ships.[@DukeOfLancastersOwn p. 157]

In 1902, the game was described in London as “a new game from South
Africa”,[@ANewGameFromSouthAfrica] and a syndicated article from 1914 also
discusses the game as having been played in the army “since the first South
African campaign”.[@GamblingInTheArmy]

References from the end of the Boer War period refer to returning British
soldiers being swindled at the game,[@RobbingTommyAtkins] returning Australian
troops playing it aboard transport ships (including the last troopship the
<cite>Drayton Grange</cite>,[@DraytonGrange] which returned over-crowded and
disease-ridden), and a report by an American who played the game with English
troops.[@FromTombsBaker]

### World War I

At the beginning of WWI the game was, at least at first, still unfamiliar to
many British soldiers, and seems to have been most strongly associated with
Australian troops. Sam Sutcliffe described a camp scene at
[Abbassia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbassia) in
1915:[@NobodyOfAnyImportance p. 191]

> Gambling was forbidden to us and, officially, it may have been to them, but a
> mighty sight worth seeing was the Australian Crown And Anchor school. Soon
> after dusk, quite some distance from their camp, a line of little lights would
> commence to twinkle. Curiosity lured me over there, spiced by the knowledge
> that, if our Military Police caught me near those wicked Aussies, I’d be in
> real trouble.{%fn%}English troops were not permitted to mingle with the
> Australians.{%endfn%} I believe I planned to vanish into the dark desert if
> trouble threatened, and make my merry way back to our camp later.
>
> I found a long line of improvised desks, a space of several yards between each
> of them. A couple of candles on each desk illuminated the Crown And Anchor
> board — actually a leatherette sheet, easily folded up and pocketed in an
> emergency, with the six symbols of the game printed on it. The operator sat on
> a box and called out his line of persuasion or temptation, such as “Come on,
> me lucky lads! The more you put down the more you pick up. Who’ll have a bet
> on the old mudhook?”{%fn%}i.e. anchor, see below.{%endfn%}
>
> Some operators always had a group of punters around them, others did less
> business. Why should some be more successful than others, even there at the
> edge of the desert? All had the same set-up, although they did vary the odds.
> The lowest offer made was to double your money if the symbol you’d backed
> turned up when the dice was thrown. Perhaps the variations which could be
> introduced by ingenious operators attracted men who applied careful thought to
> their gambling. Watching from my respectful distance, I was very impressed, at
> times amazed, at the quantity of money which changed hands.

{% imageEnd %}

As seen in the last quote, each symbol had its own nickname. The crown could
also be termed the “sergeant-major” or
“[Teddy’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII) hat”, the spade the
“shovel” or “pioneer’s tool”, the diamond the “curse” or
“[Kimberley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberley,_Northern_Cape)”, the heart
the “jam tart”, the club the “shamrock”, and the anchor the “mud-hook”,
“mud-rake”, or “meat-hook”.[@APrivateInTheGuards pp. 187-8][@TheLongTrail]

According to several observers, the game was even played on the frontlines, in
trenches. An anecdote from the [Ypres
Salient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ypres_Salient) in 1916, by a soldier of
the [King’s Royal Rifle
Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Royal_Rifle_Corps):[@JerryWinsABet]

> Alf, who owned a Crown and Anchor board of great antiquity, had it spread out
> on two petrol cans at the bottom of a shell-hole.
>
> Around it four of us squatted and began to deposit thereon our dirty half- and
> one-franc notes, with occasional coins of lesser value. The constant whistle
> of passing fragments was punctuated by the voice of Alf calling upon the
> company to “’ave a bit on the ’eart” or alternately to “’ave a dig in the
> grave”, when a spent bullet crashed on his tin hat and fell with a thud into
> the crown square.
>
> “’struth,” gasped Alf, “old squarehead wants to back the sergeant-major.” He
> gave a final shake to the cup and exposed the dice — one heart and two crowns.
> “Blimey,” exclaimed Alf, “would yer blinkin’ well believe it? Jerry’s backed a
> winner. ’Arf a mo,” and picking up the spent bullet, he threw it with all his
> might towards the German lines, exclaiming, “’Ere’s yer blinking bet back,
> Jerry, and ’ere’s yer winnings.” He cautiously fired two rounds.

Similar samples of the proprietors’ patter resound from many memoirs of the war:[@APrivateInTheGuards p. 178]

> Where you lay we pay. Come and put your money with the lucky old man. I touch
> the money, but I never touch the dice. Any more for the lucky old heart? Make
> it even on the lucky old heart. Are you all done, gentlemen? … <em>Are you all
> done?</em> … The diamond, meat-hook, and lucky old sergeant-major. (He shakes
> the dice again.) Now, then, will any one down on his luck put a little bit of
> snow (some silver) on the curse? Does any one say a bit of snow on the old
> hook? Are you all done, gentlemen? <em>Are you all done?</em> … Cocked dice
> are no man’s dice. Change your bets or double them! Now, then, <em>up she
> comes again.</em> The mud-rake, the shamrock, and the lucky old heart. Copper
> to copper, silver to silver, and <em>gold to gold</em> We shall have to drag
> the old anchor a bit. (Rattles the dice.) Now who tries his luck on the name
> of the game?

Another report from Gallipoli in 1916 also mentions it being played in trenches,
and indicates that it was associated with “colonials” (Australians and New
Zealanders):[@AnInterestingNarrative]

> I am satisifed there is as much chance of stopping colonials gambling as old
> Canute had of stopping the tide rising. I have see them playing “crown and
> anchor,” a great game with them (don’t know if you ever saw it) in all sorts
> of unlikely places, even on the fire step in first line trenches. It was funny
> on the Ionian, going back to Egypt, when there was a church parade. The padre
> paused in the sermon, and in the middle of the silence came a yell from behind
> the deck-house, “Who’s going to put a bob on the lucky old mud hook?” whilst
> straight on the bridge, and absolutely the nearest to the parson, was a ring
> of men gambling all the time, and too straight under the parson for him to see
> them. It did look comical…

In 1917 it was described as being played by “colonial” New Zealanders at an
English <abbr title="non-commissioned officer">NCO</abbr>
school:[@AtAnEnglishNCOSchool]

> Colonial slang appears strange to the “Tommy,” […] an invitation to a game of
> “pounds, coins, or browns” lets one know that the popoular gambling game of
> “crown and anchor,” for anything from a £1 note to a penny, is in progress.

In 1916, one author reported that a local toy store in Boulogne was selling game
sets to English troops.[@YearOfChivalry p. 66]

Despite all the previous quotations, some American troops believed it to be a
British game.[@HistoryOfThe107th p. 369][@307AtHomeAndInFrance p. 66]

Canadian troops also report playing the game during the
war.[@WithTheAmmunitionTrain p. 94][@MapleLeavesInFlandersFields pp. 21, 140]

In 1919, it was reported to be played on the ill-fated returning Australian
transport Sardinia.[@LifeOnTransportSardinia]

Post-war memoirs indicate that the game was commonly played in <abbr
class="initialism" title="prisoners of war">POW</abbr> camps as in the Boer
War, including the German camp <span class="noun" lang="de">Münster</span> II (<abbr
class="initialism" title="also known as">AKA</abbr> K47, <span
lang="de">Rennbahn</span>), although gambling games were not permitted to be
played.[@KaisersGuest pp. 204–6]

### World War II

In 1940, it was reported that [Australian Imperial
Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Australian_Imperial_Force) troops
stationed in Mandatory Palestine had figured out how to play the game without
dice: several [slaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodlouse) were placed
under an upturned ashtray which had indentations for resting cigarettes; the
holes from which the slaters emerged determined the winning
numbers.[@AIFSlaters]

<!-- { /* TODO <p>As in the Boer and First World Wars, the game was played by prisoners in  and concentration camps.</p>*/} -->

### Post-War

After the first and second World Wars, mentions of the game become much more
common, as the game diffused from returning soldiery back into the wider
population.

A version of the game played by workers constructing Scotland’s hydro-electric
dams in the middle of the 20th century was played with six dice, but two matches
were required to win anything.[@TheDamBuilders pp. 162–163] This version of the
game has a much higher house edge of 13.865%.

## Around the World

{% image src="../../maps/CrownAndAnchor.svg" alt="" size="wide" %}
Countries known to play Crown & Anchor.
{% imageEnd %}

The game is played in many locations around the world, some of which are
described below. Note that American-style games including casino versions are
discussed in the {% gameref chuck-a-luck %} article.

### China and amongst Peranakans

In English the Chinese name is usually given as “Hoo Hey How”; this appears to
derive from the Hokkien <span lang="nan-Latn">hû hê hāu</span> <span lang="nan">
魚蝦鱟</span>.[@GamblingGamesOfMalaya p. 109] The modern Chinese name is <span
lang="zh-Hant">魚蝦蟹</span>/<span lang="zh-Hans">鱼虾鲎</span> ‘fish prawn
crab’; these are several of the symbols that commonly appear on the staking
layout.

{% image src="chinese_board.svg" alt="" %}
Example of a Chinese-style staking layout. At the top is the manufacturer’s name
<span lang="zh">高慶坊</span> <span class="noun" lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Gāo Qìng Fāng</span>,
followed by <span lang="zh">翹骰不算</span> “cocked dice don’t count”.
{% imageEnd %}

An equivalent (perhaps older) game can be played with three standard six-sided
dice. It does not need to be played with a layout board but it can be. In this
form it can be called <span lang="nan">么二三</span> <span lang="nan-Latn">io jī
sam</span> (‘ace, two, three’, romanized “Yew Yee Sam” in older texts).[@GamblingGamesOfMalaya p. 95]

#### ‘Grasping Eight’

Culin[@ChineseGames p. 495–6] describes a very similar game that he calls
“Grasping Eight” (<span lang="yue">八㪥</span>, Cantonese: <span
lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">baat3 zaa1</span>),{%fn%}Culin transcribes this as <span
lang="yue-Latn">pát chá</span>.{%endfn%} which uses eight dice.

The staking board contains the six squares with the dice symbols {%cdice
123456%}, and players place their stakes on the squares. The eight dice are
rolled. If at least three match a number, the players who staked on that number
win 8×; if at least six match, they win 16×. All other stakes are lost.

### Indochina

The game is widely played across the countries of the Indochinese peninsula,
despite gambling being illegal in most of them. The presentation of the game is
very similar in all regions.

#### Vietnam

The Vietnamese game has a similar æsthetic to the Chinese version, including the
name: <span lang="vi">bầu cua tôm cá</span> (‘gourd crab prawn fish’).

#### Thailand

I have little information about the game in Thailand other than that the
paraphernalia for playing exists; gambling is illegal in Thailand.

From what little I have seen, the game is called <span lang="th">(น้ำ)เต้า ปู
ปลา</span> (<span lang="th-Latn">(nam)tao pu pla</span>, ‘(water)gourd crab
fish’).[@ThaiGambling p. 85] The images that the game is played with
are: goldfish (<span lang="th">ปลาทอง</span> <span
lang="th-Latn">pla-thong</span>), chicken (<span lang="th">ไก่</span> <span
lang="th-Latn">kai</span>), crab (<span lang="th">ปู</span> <span
lang="th-Latn">pu</span>), gourd (<span lang="th">เต้า</span> <span
lang="th-Latn">tao</span>), tiger (<span lang="th">เสือ</span> <span
lang="th-Latn">suea</span>), and shrimp (<span lang="th">กุ้ง</span> <span
lang="th-Latn">kung</span>). Sometimes a frog (<span lang="th">กบ</span> <span
lang="th-Latn">kop</span>) appears instead of a tiger.[@ThaiGambling p. 85]

It is possible, although difficult, to obtain official permission to play the
game at funerals.[@ThaiGambling p. 86]

### India and Nepal

The game was known in Mumbai and Pune{%fn%}Then called Bombay and
Poona.{%endfn%} as early as 1905, as indicated by court cases from the
time,[@ABookmakerAndThePolice][@HeartAnchorAndCrown] but it may have been in
India for a long time prior to that.

In current times, the game is called <span lang="hi">झंडी मुंडा</span> <span class="noun"
lang="hi-Latn">Jhaṇḍī Muṇḍā</span> (“flag crown”?), or <span lang="hi">खोर
खोरे</span> <span class="noun" lang="hi-Latn">Khor Khore</span>.

Gambling remains illegal in most of India but the game is commonly played during
[<span class="noun" lang="hi-Latn">Diwali</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali).

lang="ne">दशैं</span>) and [<span class="noun"
lang="ne-Latn">Tihar</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihar_(festival))
(<span lang="ne">तिहार</span>), and it is usually played with six dice
(requiring a minimum of two matches to pay out).

Some Nepali names for the playing-card symbols are:

### Malaysia and Brunei

In Malaysia the game can be known as <span lang="ms">ikan, udang, dan
ketam</span> (‘fish, shrimp, and crab’), <span lang="ms">ketam-ketam</span>
(‘crabs’), or <span lang="ms">yu ha hai</span> (derived from a non-Mandarin
pronunciation of the Chinese name). Chinese-style staking layouts are often
used.

The game is very popular amongst the
[Kadazan–Dusun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadazan-Dusun) people of Sabah
(Northern Borneo), where it is known as <span lang="dtp">katam-katam</span>
(‘crabs’). It is played during the festive season and also at funerals.

In Brunei the game is also known as <span
lang="kxd">katam-katam</span>.[@HuaHuiBrunei]

### Bali and Indonesia

In Bali the game is played in many forms and known under many names: <span
lang="id">mong-mongan</span> (the name of a set of three small gongs used in
Sumatra), or one of a variety of similar names such as <span
lang="id">kocok(an)</span> (‘shake’/‘shaking’, as of the dice), <span
lang="id">koprok</span>, <span lang="id">kolok</span>, or <span
lang="id">kopyok(an)</span> (also ‘shake’/‘shaker’; used also for
lotteries).[@SEAlangBalinese]

Bali is (based on appearances on the internet) possibly the part of the world
where the game is currently the most popular; this despite all gambling being
illegal in the country.

As in many cultures, gambling is often associated with religious festivals.
While other Balinese gambling activities such as the
[cock-fight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockfight#Indonesia) are restricted
to men, the game can be played by anyone, including young children.

### West Indies

The game was probably played throughout the British West Indies; there are
records of it from Trinidad,[@SportsAndPastimesInTheWestIndies p. 692], Antigua,
Jamaica, and Bermuda.[@CelebratingCricket pp. 622–3]

The game is still played today in Jamaica.

tournament), and played in large tents known as the “stock
market”.[@CupMatchAndCarnival p. 267] It is also known as Hook and
Hat.[@AScapeToBermuda p. 123]

## Fairground variants

As with {% gameref chuck-a-luck %}, the game has been adapted for mass play at
fairgrounds and carnivals. As noted on that article, the modified games usually
have worse odds for the players.
