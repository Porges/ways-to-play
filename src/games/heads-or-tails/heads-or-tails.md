# Heads or Tails

A well-known game involving flipping a coin, often used to decide fairly between two alternatives.

The earliest mention that I have found so far of the modern name of this game is in [Thomas Duffet’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Duffet) <cite>The Mock Tempest, or the Enchanted Castle</cite>, first performed in 1674:[@MockTempest 37]

> _Mir[anda]._ Well then Sifter, I’le tell y’ what, wee’l play heads or tails, who goes first, that’s far now, e’nt it?
> 
> _Dor[inda]._ Ay, and she that don’t win shall lose and keep the door.[^keepthedoor]
> 
> _Mir[anda]._ Well ther’s a good Girle, now toss up.
> 
> _Dor[inda]._ A ha! my tails turn’d up, you must watch.

[^keepthedoor]: i.e. guard the door.

> Lusus ille puerilis, "Giglio o Santo", omnibus uulgô notisimus; de cuius origine meminit Vincentius Borghinius in Tracta. Florentinæ Monetæ, nidetur a Romanis este deductus. Prætextatus enim apud Macrobium lib. 1. Satur. cap. 7. narrans, Ianum a Saturno peritiam ruris edoctum, præter cætera pro grati animi argumento eum regni societate munerâsse, ita subdit. Cum primus quoque æra signaret, seruauit & in hoc Saturni reuerentiam, ut, quoniam ille naui suerat auectus, ex unâ quidem parte sui capitis effigies, ex alterâ uerò nauis exprimeretur: quò Saturni memoriam etiam in posteros propagaret. Æs ita suisse signatum, hediéque intelligitur in aleæ lusu: cum pueri, denarios in sublime iactantes, Capita, aut nauim, lusu test uetustatis, exclamant. Pro eo quòd ignitur Romanorum pueri, Capita, aut nauim exclamabant, ut diceremus nos, "Testa, o naue", nostri inquiunt, "Giglio, o Santo".

> That childish game, "Lily or Saint," is most widely known to all; its origin is mentioned by Vincentius Borghinius in his Treatise on Florentine Coinage, and it seems to have been derived from the Romans. For Macrobius, in his first book of Saturnalia, chapter 7, relating how Janus, taught the skill of farming by Saturn, among other things, rewarded him with a share of his kingdom as a token of gratitude, adds the following: When he first minted bronze coins, he also preserved in this the reverence for Saturn, so that, since Saturn had been carried by ship, on one side of the coin his effigy would be depicted, and on the other, a ship: so that the memory of Saturn might be propagated to posterity. That bronze was thus minted is understood even today in the game of dice: when boys, throwing coins into the air, exclaim "Heads or Ship," a game that testifies to its antiquity. For what the Roman boys exclaimed, "Heads or Ship," our people say, "Lily or Saint," just as we would say, "Heads or Tails."
