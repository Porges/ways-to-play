<p class="lead">
<span class="aka">All-Fours</span> is a very old English card game for two players, dating from about the 16th century. It also spread throughout the United States, becoming a common game amongst African-Americans, and is now considered the ‘national game’ of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>.

, where it is known as <span class="aka">Seven-Up</span>.
 <span class="aka">Old Sledge</span> or <span class="aka">Seven-Up</span>[@AmericanCardPlayer p. 121]

Writing in 1866, William Brisbane Disk stated that it was “useless to inquire into the origin of this game”[@AmericanCardPlayer p. 121] — nevertheless, we shall try.

Mentioned in Cotton's @Erotopolis [109]; the name is understood to be sexual.[@SexualShakespeare1 14]

The playing-card ‘jack’ was originally called a “knave”; the term “jack” seems to have come about specifically in association with the game of All-Fours.

In the early 17th century, the costumes of the playing cards were already considered outdated; Samuel Rowlands’ <cite>The Knave of Harts</cite> (1612) contains the following poem entitled “The Knaue of <i>Harts</i> his Supplication to Card-markers” (if the poem is too long, I have em<b>bold</b>ened an interesting section):[@KnaveOfHarts]

VVEe are abuſed in a great degree;<br>
For, there’s no Knaues ſo wronged as are wee<br>
By thoſe that chiefely ſhould be our part-takers:<br>
And thus it is my Maiſters, you <em>Card-makers</em>,<br>
All other Knaues are at their owne free-will,<br>
To braue it out, and follow faſhion ſtill<br>
In any cut, according to the time,<br>
But we poore Knaues (I know not for what crime)<br>
Are kept in pie-bald Suites, which we haue worne<br>
Hundreds of yeares, this hardly can be borne.

We are abused in a great degree,<br>
For, there’s no Knaves so wronged as are we<br>
By those that chiefly should be our part-takers:<br>
And thus it is my Masters, you *Card-makers*,<br>
All other Knaves are at their own free-will,<br>
To brave it out, and follow fashion still<br>
In any cut, according to the time,<br>
But we poor Knaves (I know not for what crime)<br>
Are kept in pie-bald Suits, which we have worn<br>
Hundreds of years, this hardly can be borne.
