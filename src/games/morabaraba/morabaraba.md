<span class="noun" lang="st">Morabaraba</span> is played across south-eastern Africa.
{% imageEnd %}

<span class="noun" lang="st">Morabaraba</span> is a [mill game](/articles/mill-games/) from
south-eastern Africa. The gameplay of the standardized version is very similar
to {% gameref twelve-mens-morris %}  (with a few minor differences), but the
version played in Lesotho has a unique board.

<!-- excerpt -->

<span class="noun" lang="st">Morabaraba</span> is played as a competitive sport in South
Africa, administered by [Mind Sports South Africa](http://mindsportsa.co.za/).
It is widely played throughout the country; a poll conducted by <cite>The
Sowetan</cite> in 1996 indicated that 40% of South Africans played the
game.[@MorabarabaGetOnBoard]

## History

Surprisingly, unlike most board games we know who was responsible for
transmitting the game from Europe:[@MkeleMorabaraba p.
134][@FromBearnToSouthernAfrica p. 79] it was introduced to Lesotho—then called
Basutoland—some time between 1832 and 1855 by Eugène Casalis, a French
protestant missionary who acted as Foreign Advisor to [King Moshoeshoe
I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshoeshoe_I) for nearly two
decades.{%fn%}Casalis is also sometimes also referred to as Cazalis in English
sources. Upon his return to France he wrote about his experiences in <cite
lang="fr">Les Bassoutos: Vingt-Trois Années de Séjour et D’Observations au Sud
de L’Afrique</cite> (Paris, 1859) (later published in English as <cite>The
Basutos: or Twenty-Three Years in South Africa</cite> (London: Nisbet, 1861)),
but the book contains no mention of any board games. There is now [a
roundabout](https://goo.gl/maps/jymZMMft3fB2) in his home town, <span class="noun"
lang="fr">Orthez</span>, [named after
him](http://www.larepubliquedespyrenees.fr/2013/02/16/un-nom-pour-les-ronds-points-la-gare-routiere-et-la-rocade,1118172.php).{%endfn%}
The introduction of the game had unintended consequences for the mission: young
men preferred to play the game rather than attend
mass.[@FromBearnToSouthernAfrica p. 79] Obsession with the game also led herders
to neglect their flocks,[@FromBearnToSouthernAfrica p. 79] so it became known by
the epithet <span lang="st">sethetsabadisana</span> ‘deceiver of the
herd-boys’:‌[@BasothoChildren p. 41] “for when you play it, old or young, you
forget your herds, and they wander into the corn…”‌[@TheWorldAndCattle p. 56]

The game was also popular amongst Basotho men who travelled to South Africa to
work in its mines. References to <span class="noun" lang="st">Morabaraba</span> can be found
in <span lang="st">difela</span>/<span lang="st">lifela</span> (singular <span
lang="st">sefela</span>), song–poems that were sung by these migrant
workers.[@BasothoOralPoetry pp. 17, 175, 229][@TimeOfCannibals pp. 98–101]

In Lesotho’s past the game was restricted to being played by men, to the point
that women were not permitted in the vicinity of the gaming
area.[@SesothoFarming p. 95] Thankfully, times have changed, and as of 2021, the
top-ranked player in Mind Sports South Africa’s league is a woman, named Saudah
Bhaimia, who has won the last three national championships.[@SaudahBhaimia]

Casalis was stationed at Moshoeshoe’s stronghold
[Thaba-Bosiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaba_Bosiu), which was positioned
atop a sandstone plateau.
{% imageEnd %}

## Terminology

The name <span lang="st">moraba-raba</span> comes from the Sesotho language, and
is related to the verb <span lang="st">ho raba raba</span> ‘to roam in small
circles’,[@SeSothoDictionary p. 304] so could refer to the action of a mill.‌ In
Nguni languages (isiZulu, isiXhosa), it is known as <span class="noun"
lang="zu">(Um)labalaba</span>, with similar meaning,‌[@GamesBasotho pp. 247–50]
and in Ronga, spoken in Mozambique, it is called <span class="noun"
lang="rng">Muravarava</span>.

{%aside%}
There are two different [Sesotho
orthographies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesotho_orthography). In this
article I give the South African one first, followed by the Lesotho.

balaclava: most of Lesotho is above 1&#x202f;800&nbsp;m, so it is cooler than
many neighbouring countries.
{% imageEnd %}

There are other names which are probably derived from the European name of
‘mill’:‌[@MkeleMorabaraba p. 134] an alternate Sesotho name is <span
lang="st">mmila</span>/<span lang="st">’mila</span>,
‘road’.‌[@UsingGamesToPromote p. 283] In Botswana,[@CulturalGamesBotswana] the game is called <span
lang="tn">mhele</span> (‘reedbuck’, a type of antelope‌[@OldTswana p. 350]), and
the name <span lang="tn">morabaraba</span> refers solely to a mancala
game.{%fn%}Because of the large overlap of names, in written descriptions <span class="noun"
lang="st">Morabaraba</span> is often confused with or included in lists of other
mancala games, such as <span lang="ve">mefuvha</span> (from Limpopo) or <span
lang="sn">tsoro</span> (from Mozambique/Zimbabwe) (see, for example,
@MorabarabaGetOnBoard).{%endfn%}

A distinctive feature of this game is its bovine theme: in each language, the
pieces are called ‘cows’. In Sesotho this is <span
lang="st">dikgomo</span>/<span lang="st">likhomo</span> (singular <span
lang="st">kgomo</span>/<span lang="st">khomo</span>);‌[@UseOfMorabara p. 588] in
isiZulu it is <span lang="zu">izinkomo</span> (singular <span
lang="zu">inkomo</span>). In isiZulu a mill is a {% pronounce
pronouncer="Lungii" word="isibhamu" lang="zu" %} (‘gun’), which allows you to
“shoot” an opponent’s cow, while in Sesotho the mill is called a <span
lang="st">molamu</span> (a staff carried by shepherds), and you can eat (<span
lang="st">ja</span>) a cow.[@BasothoChildren p. 36]

## Play

The following description is based on Mind Sports South Africa’s “Generally
Accepted Rules”. As with all traditional board games, local rules can vary.

Each player has 12 pieces. Commonly, plastic or metal bottle caps{%fn%}The use
of bottle caps is so common that even [commercial sets use bottle
caps](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMBbRAzBg1z/), and they show up in
[computerized versions](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf-isgxnIPF/) as a
skeuomorphic feature.{%endfn%} are used in two contrasting colours.

  src="../../articles/mill-games/large_merels_with_diagonals.svg"
  alt="" %}
Standard <span class="noun" lang="st">Morabaraba</span> is played on the large mill board with diagonals.
{% imageEnd %}

During the placement phase, players must place a single piece on any vacant
point of the board. Once all their pieces are placed, players can move a single
piece to another vacant point, along one of the lines.

If a player places or moves a piece to form a new mill, they remove one of the
opponent’s pieces. The removed piece may not be from a mill unless there are no
other pieces that can be removed.

During the placement phase it is possible to form two mills at once. In
<span class="noun" lang="st">Morabaraba</span> this only allows a player to remove one piece.

When a player is reduced to three pieces, their pieces can ‘fly’ and move to any
vacant point on the board, ignoring the lines.

A player loses the game when they are reduced to fewer than three pieces, or if
they are unable to make a valid move on their turn.

{% imageEnd %}

In tournament play, Mind Sports adopted an additional rule: During the movement
phase, a piece that is moved from one mill to form another mill may not move
back to form a mill again at the original point on the next turn. Instead, a
different move must be taken before doing so. This rule prevents a player from
moving backwards and forwards between two mills quickly. This rule seems to me
to be unlikely to be used in casual play.

## Analysis

With perfect play, the first player can force a win in 49
moves.[@UltraStrongMorris]

## Variants

### Sotho version

{% image 
    position="right"
    src="large_merels_with_diagonals_and_centre.svg"
    alt="" %}
The Sotho version of the game is played on a board with a central cross.
{% imageEnd %}

The Sotho version of the game is played on a special board or flat stone (<span
lang="st">letlapa</span>)[@BasothoChildren p. 35] where the centre square is
also crossed, and the inner diagonals are missing, giving 25 points that can be
played on.‌[@IndigenousGamesRuleBook][@MkeleMorabaraba p. 133] This means that
there is no possibility of a deadlock after the placement phase.

Most rulesets state that a piece on the central point can only be the middle
piece of a mill. Other lines of three formed with the central point do not count
as mills.[@BlacUmlabalaba][@TicTacToe pp. 67–70]

Note that it is not possible to form a diagonal mill on this board.

with a diagonally crossed central square. I do not know if the rules vary in any
way.
