<p class="lead">
My Sow Has Pigged is a game that was already described as ‘obsolete’ in the 19th
century.[@TheAmericanHoyle3 p. 484] It seems to have been popular from the 17th to 18th centuries.
It was at first a gambling game, and then a children’s game, and was played with a standard 52-card deck.

Other than that, the rules are not known. From several references, the aim of
the game was to achieve a hand entirely composed of cards of the same suit, by
swapping cards with other players. Thus it is similar (perhaps even the same
game) as {% gameref whehee %}, but it is hard to say without knowing the exact
rules.

A rhyme recited by the winner was:

Higgory, diggory, digg’d,<br/>
My sow has pigg’d.[@PopularRhymes p. 114]

## History

In 1603 [Samuel Harsnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Harsnett)
(1561–1631) — at the time archdeacon of Essex — listed it as “my sow hath pigd”
amongst several other ‘Christmas games’ in his <cite>Declaration of Egregious
Popish Impostures</cite>.[@PopishImpostures p. 116]

[Thomas Middleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Middleton)’s 1619 play
<cite>The Inner-Temple Masque, or Masque of Heroes</cite> alludes to the
game amongst several others, as part of a facetious ‘last will and testament’:

> <i>Item</i>, I leaue to their old Aunt, <i>my Sow h’as Pigd</i>,<br/>
> a Litter of Curtizans to breede vp for Shroue-tide.[@InnerTempleMasque]

In 1621, the poet James Taylor included it in [a list of
games](/articles/lists/john-taylor/) as “my-sow-pigg’d”; and in 1629, Thomas
Crosfield mentioned it [in his diary](/articles/lists/thomas-crosfield/) as “My
Sewe has Pig’d”.

It is mentioned by [Fanny Burney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Burney) in her
journal of 1770, alongside other card games that she played: “Pope Joan, my
lady’s hole [later corrected by herself to ‘commerce’], or <i>my sow’s
Pig’d</i>”.[@FannyBurney p. 121]

In later sources it is said to be the same as “My Bird Sings”.[@TaylorHistory p.
311]{%fn%}This reference also mentions “my hen hath laid”, but that is apparently a
different game (see {%gameref circle-chases%}).{%endfn%}
