<span lang="id" class="aka noun">Permainan-Tabal</span> (“drum game”) is an Indonesian game.[^fn0] The name of the game probably relates to the shape of the board, which resembles a drum.[^fn1]

[^fn0]: The name is sometimes given as only <span lang="id" class="aka noun">Permainan</span>, but that merely means “game” in Indonesian.

[^fn1]: Compare also with the Japanese <span lang="ja">輪鼓</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">ryūgo</span> drum-shape symbol.


The following is a different game:

Known as <span lang="jv-Latn" class="aka noun">Surakarta</span> (<span lang="jv" class="aka noun">ꦯꦸꦫꦏꦂꦠ</span>), after the historical capital city of Java.[@OxfordBG p. 249]
