# <span lang="ja">カックリ</span> · <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Kakkuri</span>

<Pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" noun="true" lang="ja-Latn" file='pronunciation_ja_がっくり.mp3'>Kakkuri</Pronounce> (<span lang="ja">カックリ</span>) is the last surviving <span lang="ja-Latn">yomi</span> (<span lang="ja">読み</span>, ‘reading’) card game in Japan.[@KakkuriYomi] In 2005, it was still played in the town of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yafune</span>, part of the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echizen,_Fukui"><span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Echizen</span>, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Fukui</span> prefecture</a> (<span lang="ja">福井県越前市矢船町</span>).

## Equipment

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kakkuri</span> is played with <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn"
file='pronunciation_ja_小松札.mp3' pronouncer="poyotan">komatsufuda</Pronounce>
(<span lang="ja">小松札</span>), a deck of 48 cards which run from 1–12 in four
suits. Alternatively, it can be played with <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>
cards if you are very familiar with the deck ordering, or you can play with a
standard deck of cards by removing all <Cards>⑩</Cards>s.

## Setup

As in other Japanese games, all actions (dealing and playing) are performed in
an anti-clockwise direction.

The game is usually played for money: a stake should be decided between the
players, and all payments are made in multiples of this stake (1×, 2×, 3×).
Otherwise, these can be counted as points.

To begin, deal 6 cards to each player in groups of 3. The remaining cards are
set in a stack face-down in the middle of the table; this is called the ‘box’
(<span lang="ja">箱</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="poyotan" lang="ja-Latn" file='pronunciation_ja_箱.mp3'>hako</Pronounce>).

If there are 8 people playing, then there will be no cards leftover to form the box; instead, whoever received the <Cards>3</Cards> of <span lang="ja-Latn">pao</span> (or <Cards>c3</Cards> with standard deck) drops out and their hand is shuffled to become the box.

Before looking at their cards, each player in turn can exchange their hand with
the dealer’s hand. This can happen multiple times so that players can end up
with the hands of previous players if multiple players swapped.

Next, the players look at their cards. If any player has been dealt the non-red
<Cards>1</Cards>s of <span lang="ja-Latn">isu</span>, <span
lang="ja-Latn">ouru</span>, and <span lang="ja-Latn">kotsu</span> (or <Cards>sAdAhA</Cards> if playing with standard playing cards), then they win instantly and are paid 3× by each other player. This is called <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn" pronouncer="poyotan" file='pronunciation_ja_打たず.mp3'>utazu</Pronounce> <span
lang="ja">ウタズ</span> (from <span lang="ja">打たず</span>, “without playing”).

> The <Cards>1</Cards>s of <span lang="ja-Latn">isu</span>, <span lang="ja-Latn">ouru</span>, and <span lang="ja-Latn">kotsu</span>.

## Play

To start play, the dealer turns up the top card of the box, which will count as
the first card played. The dealer then takes the first turn.

On a player’s turn they may play several cards. Each card must be one rank
higher than the last card played (e.g. if the last card is a <Cards>3</Cards>,
you can only play a <Cards>4</Cards>). However, a <Cards>1</Cards> can be played
after a <Cards>1</Cards>, and a <Cards>2</Cards> can be played after a <Cards>2</Cards>. When the last card played is a <Cards>12</Cards> <span
lang="ja-Latn">kiri </span>(or <Cards>K</Cards>), then any rank can be played next. Suits do not matter, and cards are played on the table in front of the
person playing them, rather than in the middle of the table (this makes it easier to see how many cards each player has remaining).

In addition, the <Cards>1</Cards> of <span lang="ja-Latn">pao</span> (<Cards>cA</Cards>) and <Cards>2</Cards> of <span lang="ja-Latn">ouru</span> (<Cards>d2</Cards>) are wild and can be played as any other card. If turned up from the box they count as a normal <Cards>1</Cards> &amp; <Cards>2</Cards>.

> The wild cards: <Cards>1</Cards> of <span lang="ja-Latn">pao</span> and {% cards '2' %} of <span lang="ja-Latn">ouru</span>.

There are two other special cases that allow more than one card of the same rank
to be played:

* If a player has three cards of the same rank they can play all of them together. Four cannot be played together, but you can play three cards out of a set of four.
* If a player’s hand consists of three pairs, then any time before they play their first card they can declare ‘three pairs’ (<span lang="ja">三足</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="usako_usagiclub" lang="ja-Latn" file='pronunciation_ja_三足.mp3'>sansoku</Pronounce>). After that they can (and must) play their cards in pairs.

Once a player has finished their turn, they say “pass” and it is the next
player’s turn. Passing is ‘soft’ and doesn’t prevent a player from playing again
later in the round.

As long as they haven’t played any cards yet, a player can drop out on their
turn by paying 1× to the pot.

After all players pass in a row without playing, the last player that played any
cards can either take another turn, or turn up a new card from the box and then
take another turn.

The first player to get rid of all their cards wins and all other players (who
did not drop out) must pay 1× to the pot, which the winner takes. If a player
wins by playing all their cards in one go, then everyone else must pay 2×
instead; this is called <span lang="ja">グリ</span> <span
lang="ja-Latn">guri</span>. Note that you can still claim <span
lang="ja-Latn">guri</span> if you have had previous turns but did not play any
cards, so if you see someone passing a lot without playing any cards, be
careful!

The winner becomes the dealer for the next game.
