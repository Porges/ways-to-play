# <span lang="hi">तीन दो पाँच</span> · <span lang="hi-Latn" class="noun">Teen Do Pānch</span>

<span lang="hi-Latn" class="noun aka">Teen Do Pānch</span> (<span lang="hi" class="aka">तीन दो पाँच</span> <span lang="hi-Latn">tīn dō pānch</span>) is a three-player card game from India. The name of the game means “<span class="aka">Three Two Five</span>” in Hindi.

Ten tricks are played, and each player must make a certain number depending on
their position in relation to the dealer.

## Setup

From a standard deck, remove all cards except for <Cards>8–A</Cards> in each
suit, plus the <Cards>h7</Cards> and <Cards>s7</Cards>, leaving 30 cards total.

## Play

Deal all of the cards out in three rounds, in packets of 5–3–2.

After receiving their first 5 cards, the first player must choose the trump suit. If they decline, turn up their next 3 cards, and the trump suit is that of the highest card. (**Alternate deal:** deal in packets of 5–5 and, if first player declines, the trump suit is randomly chosen from their next 5 cards.)

Each player must try to win the number of tricks allocated to them based on their playing order: the first player must win 5 tricks, the second 3 tricks, and the dealer 2 tricks.

Play tricks according to the usual trick-taking rules: players must follow suit if possible, otherwise they can trump or discard.

After all 10 tricks have been played, the score of each player is the difference between what they were required to make, and what they made. If they made more than they needed, their score will be positive, and if they made less than they needed, then their score will be negative.

### Pulling cards

In each following round, after the deal, those players who made more than they
were required may take one random card per extra trick from those who failed to
make their required tricks, in exchange for a card from their own hand.

The pulling player may not return the card that was taken.
