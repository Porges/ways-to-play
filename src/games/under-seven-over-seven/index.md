<p class="lead">
Under Seven or Over Seven is a simple dice game that used to be played in
England as an (illegal) attraction at race courses or fairs.[@ChelseaBuns]

It is sometimes simply known as “Unders and Overs”.[@UndersAndOvers] The
earliest mention I have found of it in newspapers is from 1803.[@usos1803]

## Rules

The game is simple: it is usually played with a staking layout, upon which are
two bets labelled ‘Under 7’ and ‘Over 7’, and two dice.

To play, the players stake their bets on the bet that they choose, and the proprietor then rolls the two dice. The winning bet is paid out at 1&ratio;1. If the proprietor rolls 7, then both bets lose. If paid out at 1&ratio;1 then both bets are equivalent and have a high house edge of 16.67%.

In some versions of the game, there is also a bet labelled ‘7’, which wins and pays out 3&ratio;1 or 4&ratio;1 if the proprietor rolls 7. The house edge on this bet at a 4&ratio;1[@UndersAndOvers] payout is the same as the other bets; at 3&ratio;1[@SharpsAndFlats p. 246] it is a huge 33.33%.

In the past, staking layouts were sometimes labelled “O.S.”, “U.S.”, and “S.”, perhaps to make the game less obvious to police.[@USOS] Another labelling scheme is simply “O”, “U”, and “7”.[@GamblingNearTheZoologicalGardens][@CompleteHoyle97]
