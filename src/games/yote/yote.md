<p class="lead">
<span class="aka noun" lang="wo">Yoté</span> is a game from Senegal.
{%fn%}Many existing sources use the spelling <span class="aka noun" lang="wo">Yoté</span>, but the <i>o</i> seems to be long according to @VolofFrancais [p. 379] and evidence from native speakers online, so this should perhaps be Yooté.{%endfn%}
