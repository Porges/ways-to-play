Tri-Hex is a [mill game](/articles/mill-games/) that was invented by T. H.
O’Beirne in 1962. It was first described in an article in <cite>New
Scientist</cite> magazine, and was derived by exploring alternate board
configurations for {% gameref tic-tac-toe %}.[@TriHex]

## Rules

The Tri-Hex board.
{% imageEnd %}

Each player has four pieces, which are first (the placement phase) placed one at
a time on the board. Once all the pieces are on the board, players take turns
moving a single piece along a line to the (single) vacant location. The first
player to form a row of three along a line wins the game (this can be during
either of the placement or movement phases).

O’Beirne provides analysis of the play in the original article (below in References).
