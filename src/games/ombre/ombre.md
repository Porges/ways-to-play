# Ombre

<span class="aka">Ombre</span>, or <span class="aka">Hombre</span>, is one of the earliest card games that was played in Europe. Originally played in Spain as a game for four, it became popularized throughout the continent as a three-player game until other games later overtook it in popularity. Despite this it has survived until this day in some locations, still being played in Denmark and on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, where it is called <span class="aka noun" lang="bug">Omi</span>.

Other games directly derived from Ombre include the [unsun-karuta](articles/cards/japan/unsun-karuta/unsun-karuta.md) games of Japan, while the bidding system influenced many other card games.[@OmbreEtLumiere p. 101]

## History

The earliest given rules to the game date from French and English books from the mid-late 17th century.

It is first mentioned in a letter in England in 1660,[@OmbreEtLumiere p. 104] and then in the @WitsInterpreter_2e from 1662.[^fn0] This text was plagiarized in its entirety for Cotton’s @CompleatGamester in 1674.

[^fn0]: It does not appear in the first edition of the <cite>Wits Interpreter</cite> from 1655.

In France, the @JeuDeLHombre_1674 was published in 1674, and then reprinted in revised form in 1682 as @JeuDeLHombre_1682. In Italy, the legal work <cite lang="la">Theatrum veritatis et justitiae</cite> by [Cardinal Giovannii Battista de Luca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_de_Luca) mentioned the game in 1671,[^fn1] and explicitly stated that the original version was for four players.[@OmbreEtLumiere p. 106] The early English and French sources make no mention of the ancestral form.

[^fn1]: A later edition is available online: @BaptisteTheatrum7 [p. 301].

All of these early sources agree that the game was originally from Spain. However, there are no Spanish rulebooks konwn from this early period aside from one book published in 1669.[@OmbreEtLumiere2 p. 10] This book — entitled <cite lang="es">Leyes, y Constituciones del juego del Hombre, compuestas, y aora nuevamente recopiladas por el Doctor Benedicto Clauco</cite> (<cite>Laws, and Constitutions of the Game of Hombre, composed, and now newly compiled by Doctor Benedicto Clauco</cite>) — appears to interpolate commentary with the contents of an earlier book published in 1631, of which no extant copies are known.[@OmbreEtLumiere2 p. 11] However, it only includes rules only for the four-player version of the game, which de Luca would describe as the ‘primitive’ form in 1671. 

Somewhat ironically, Quadrille — a later four-player development of Ombre — would eclipse Ombre, until the arrival of Whist, which took Quadrille’s place.[@ObservationsOnTheAntiquityOfCardPlaying p. 145]
