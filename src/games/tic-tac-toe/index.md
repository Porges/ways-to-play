<p class="lead">Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game for two players that is
well-known to result in a draw if played ‘rationally’. Unlike most board games,
pieces cannot be moved or removed once placed, making it an ideal game to
play with pen & paper.</p>

Some tic-tac-toe games.

## History

The origins of tic-tac-toe are unclear. Many sources claim that it dates from
antiquity, but to me it seems like a more recent invention—a degenerate version
of Three Men’s Morris. Mentions of it only appear in the 19th century, and the
game is very well suited to being played with chalk on slates—such as were used
by children in schools during this period. Indeed, @BerkshirePhrases [p. 164]
describes the game as “the first game taught to children when they can use a
slate pencil”.

However, there is an early antecedent of a game which is equivalent in play, if
not in presentation. [Alfonso X of
Castile’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_X_of_Castile) <cite>Book of
Games</cite>[@AlfonsoGames], published in 1283, includes the game <span
lang="es">alquerque de tres</span> which is played on a small merels board with
diagonals. Each player has three pawns which they place on the board one at a
time, taking turns. If a player can form three in a line then they win;
otherwise it is a tie. Later historians (even including [H. J. R.
Murray](/articles/people/hjr-murray/)[@Murray2]) have muddied the waters by
describing this game as a three-men’s-morris game where the pieces can be moved
after being placed, but this is not supported by the original
manuscript.[@DimensionsOfBookOfGames p. 609]

Some of the earliest known written references to Tic-Tac-Toe in English occur in
Charles Babbage’s unpublished manuscript <cite>Essays on the Philosophy of Analysis</cite>
(1812–1820, now held in the British Library as Add. MS&nbsp;37202), although the
game is never mentioned by name.[@SourcesInRecreationalMathematics] In 1842,
‘tit-tat-to’ again occurs in his notebooks, when he conceptualizes an automaton
that would play the game against a
human.[@SourcesInRecreationalMathematics][@ICommencedAnExamination]

It also appears in 1818 in an article on the [Lancasterian
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitorial_System), discussing children’s
games:[@LancasterianSystem]

> One boy who is acquainted with the popular game of <i>checkers</i>, <i>fox and
> geese</i>, <i>tit-tat-to</i>, <i>hop skip and jump</i>, and a thousand other
> childish amusements,  will communicate all he knows to his school companions
> with surprising facility.

In 1830, [Robert Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(Radical))
(an anti-clerical Radical, nicknamed “the Devil’s chaplain”) used tic-tac-toe as
an example of a children’s game in his sermon “The Star of
Bethlehem”:[@DevilsPulpit p. 7]

> Just as a fool, who has but seen the diagrams and delineations in the elements
> of Euclid, will make himself dead sure that all the mathematics in the world
> could have consisted in nothing more than in making hobscotches [hop-scotch],
> and catgallowses [a high-jump], and scratchcradles [cat’s cradle], to play at
> tit-tat-toe with.

## Terminology

In English, tic-tac-toe has gone by many names. It has been variously called
‘tit-tat-to(e)’, ‘tic(k)-tac(k)-to(e)’, ‘(n)oughts &amp; crosses’, ‘crisscross’,
‘tip-tap-toe’,[@Teesdale p. 136][@NotesAndQueriesS8V12 p. 333] ‘Exeter’s Nose’
(a pun on ‘<i>X</i>s and <i>O</i>s’),[@SourcesInRecreationalMathematics] or
‘kit-cat-cannio’.[@SuffolkWords p. 200]

Several of these names derive from old counting-out rhymes — think ‘eeny meeny
miny mo’ — that begin with ‘tit, tat, toe’. These rhymes date from at least the
early 18th century: in 1725, @ANewCantingDictionary described ‘Tit-Tat’ as “the
aiming of Children to go at first”.

The fullest expression of this rhyme is along the lines of:

> Tit, tat, toe,<br />
> My first go,<br />
> Three jolly butcher boys<br />
> All in a row;<br />
> Stick one up,<br />
> Stick one down,<br />
> Stick one in the old man’s crown!{%fn%}Some sources (e.g. @NurseryWitch [p. 374]) give this last line as “… in the old man’s (burial-)ground!”; I have no idea what this means.{%endfn%}

Aside from its use as a counting-out rhyme, ‘tit-tat-to’ was used to refer to
any set of three lined-up objects — in [F. W. N. Bayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._N._Bayley)’s 1842
adaptation of the gruesome [Bluebeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebeard) fairy-tale, Mrs.
Bluebeard discovers that her husband has murdered his six previous wives,
and:[@ComicNurseryTales p. 19]

> […] —ah! no more!<br />
> She bumps her body down on the floor;<br />
> Down on the floor—and, Oh, my eye!<br />
> She looks as if she were ready to die!<br />
> It isn’t a case of “tit-tat-toe,”<br />
> And “three jolly butchers all of a row,”<br />
> But Oh . . . Oh . . . Oh . . ! ! !<br />
> It’s a double case of tit-tat-toe,<br />
> <span class="smallcaps">And Six Dead Women all of a Row.</span>{%fn%}Supposedly this is a children’s book.{%endfn%}

This usage of referring to neatly-aligned triplets is still current with the
Swedish equivalent of {% pronounce
file='pronunciation_sv_tripp,_trapp,_trull.mp3' lang="sv" pronouncer="tigris"
word="tripp, trapp, trull" %} (see more below). The three houses in
[Kalmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar) in the following image are
nicknamed the “<span lang="sv">tripp trapp trull</span> houses”:

{% imageEnd %}

The same rhyme and name were also used for an unrelated game, using a circular
board, in which a player would attempt to locate high-scoring sections of a
circle while blindfolded.[@GamesBookForBoysAndGirls p. 55]

There seems to be a distinction we can draw between languages that have folkish
names and those that have more functional names derived from the outward
appearance or goal of the game.

{% aside %}@SkeatTitTatTo also gives the Frisian name “<span
lang="ofs">Tik-Tak-Tuk</span>” as a possible source for the English phrase, but
after examining his source,[@Koolman p. 410] it is the name of a different game
similar to <span lang="de">Rösselsprungrätsel</span>. However, it does come with
its own rhyming phrase: <span lang="nl">„tik-tak-tuk, hê sitt in ’t huk”</span>.
Interestingly, “Tik-Tak-Tuk” is also the name of the game in Indonesian.{% endaside %}

In the ‘folkish’ group we have examples like the Dutch ‘<span lang="nl">tik tak
tol</span>’,[@Fiske p. 122] or ‘<span lang="nl">boter-kaas-en-eieren</span>’
(‘butter cheese and eggs’); and the Swedish ‘<span lang="sv">tripp, trapp,
trull</span>’.[@Fiske p. 137]

Like the English names, one Dutch name (<span lang="nl">boter, melk,
kaas</span>) is derived from a rhyme:[@WinningWaysV3 p. 732]

<div class="multi text-center">
  <p lang="nl">Boter, melk, kaas,<br />ik ben de baas.</p>
  <p>Butter, milk, cheese,<br />I am the boss.</p>
</div>

Sweden had a similar rhyme:[@GamesOfTheGods p. 163]

<div class="multi text-center">
  <p lang="sv">Tripp, trapp, trull,<br />min kvarn är full.</p>
  <p>Tripp, trapp, trull,<br />my mill is full.</p>
</div>

In the ‘functional’ group of names are those like the Arabic <span
lang="ar">لعبة إكس-أو</span> ‘the <i>X</i>–<i>O</i> game’; or the Chinese <span
lang="zh">圈圈叉叉</span> ‘circles &amp; crosses’, or <span lang="zh">井字棋
</span> ‘<code>井</code> character game’.

The languages with ‘folkish’ names also tend to have ‘functional’ names as well;
an alternate Swedish name is ‘<span lang="sv">tre-i-rad</span>’ (‘three in a
row’), and Dutch has the straightforward ‘<span lang="nl">kruisje rondje</span>’
(‘cross circle’).

On the other hand, the English poet Wordsworth didn’t think the game was worthy
of a name at all. In <cite>The Prelude</cite>, he describes playing the game as
a child:[@Wordsworth ll. 538–544]

> Eager and never weary we pursued<br />
> Our home-amusements by the warm peat-fire<br />
> At evening, when with pencil and smooth slate,<br />
> In square divisions parcelled out, and all<br />
> With crosses and with cyphers{%fn%}“cyphers” here means “zeroes”{%endfn%} scribbled o’er<br />
> We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head<br />
> In strife too humble to be named in verse

### Other languages

In Greek it is called <span lang="el">τρίλιζα</span> (<span
lang="el-Latn">triliza</span>), or <span lang="el">πατητό</span> (<span
lang="el-Latn">patito</span>) in Thessaloniki.{%fn%}This is given in @Butito as
“butito”, played in Larnaca on Cyprus. <span lang="el-Latn">Patito</span>
(‘stepping’) is also used for hopscotch.{%endfn%}

## Play

You know this, right?

## Strategy

See, e.g. @Gardner1 [pp. 37–46].

<!-- It is claimed that “yih” 弈 is an old name for the game. No, this is go, or maybe something older. -->

## Variants

### The 15 Game
This game is also known as “Number Scrabble”[@TheGameOfJAM] or “Pick15”.

To play: Write down the numbers from 1–9 on a piece of paper. Each turn, a
player claims a number for themselves by marking it, and a number can only be
claimed by one player. The first player to claim 3 numbers that add to 15 is the
winner.

This game is isomorphic to the game of tic-tac-toe. Astonishingly, this form was
invented by Babbage in his initial analysis of the game.[@MathematicalWorkOfBabbage p. 127]

To show the equivalence, write down the numbers in the form of the (unique) 3&times;3 magic square:

<table class="numeric rule-between-cells">
  <tbody class="table-group-divider">
    <tr><td>4</td><td>9</td><td>2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>6</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

From this it can be seen that the game is the same as tic-tac-toe. Each row, column, and long diagonal sums to 15.

### JAM

This is another isomorphic variant invented by John Michon.[@TheGameOfJAM] It is
the [projective geometry
dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry)) of the
standard game, where each cell is replaced by a line and each winning line by a
point, in such a way that each cell-line intersects the appropriate winning-line
points.  

If this is confusing, muse upon the following diagram: the red solid vertical
line represents the middle cell of the Tic-Tac-Toe board; it crosses four points
(winning lines). The four blue dashed lines are the corner cells, which cross
three points (winning lines) each, and the four green dotted lines are the
side-centre cells, which cross two points (winning lines) each.

{% image 
  src="jam.svg"
  alt="" %}

{% imageEnd %}

To play, players take turns claiming an entire line, which crosses several
points. Once a player has claimed a line it may not be claimed by the other
player. The first player that claims all three lines that pass through any
single point wins the game.

### Spit

Yet another isomorphic variant is played as follows:[@WinningWaysV3 p. 732]

Write down the nine words ‘Spit’, ‘Not’, ‘So’, ‘Fat’, ‘Fop’, ‘As’, ‘If’, ‘In’,
and ‘Pan’ on separate pieces of paper. The players take turns taking a single
card. A player wins if they collect all the cards with a given letter (e.g.
‘In’, ‘If’, and ‘Spit’ would win since these are all the words containing ‘i’).  

This can be shown to be the same game in the following way (note that the number
of letters in each word is the same as the number of lines that can be formed
through that square):

<table class="text-center rule-first-row rule-first-col rule-last-col rule-last-row">
  <tbody class="table-group-divider">
    <tr>
      <td><strong >P</strong></td>
      <td><strong >N</strong></td>
      <td><strong >S</strong></td>
      <td><strong >F</strong></td>
      <td><strong >T</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong >A</strong></td>
      <td><span>P</span><span >A</span><span >N</span></td>
      <td><span>A</span><span >S</span></td><td><span >F</span><span >A</span><span >T</span></td>
      <td><strong >A</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong >I</strong></td>
      <td><span >I</span><span >N</span></td>
      <td><span >S</span><span >P</span><span >I</span><span >T</span></td>
      <td><span >I</span><span >F</span></td>
      <td><strong >I</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong >O</strong></td>
      <td><span >N</span><span >O</span><span >T</span></td>
      <td><span >S</span><span >O</span></td>
      <td><span >F</span><span >O</span><span >P</span> </td>
      <td><strong >O</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong >T</strong></td>
      <td><strong >N</strong></td>
      <td><strong >S</strong></td>
      <td><strong >F</strong></td>
      <td><strong >P</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Automatic Players

Being a simple game, Tic-Tac-Toe is easily programmed, and so was one of the
first automated games. As noted above, Charles Babbage studied the problem but
never built an actual machine.

The earliest fully automated player was constructed by a Frank T. Freeland of
Philadelphia, who described its implementation in an 1879 journal
article.[@AutomaticTTT] According to the article, the machine was built and
exhibited in 1878 before being moved to the University of Pennsylvania. Its
whereabouts (if it still exists) are currently unknown.{%fn%}For more about
Freeland, see @VictorianTTT.{%endfn%} This machine predates any other
implementations by some 70 years!

Later (but still early, in the computing world) implementations of the game include:

* [<cite>Bertie the Brain</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_the_Brain) (analog, 1950)
* [<cite>OXO</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OXO) (for the EDSAC, 1952)
* <cite>Relay Moe</cite>[@RelayMoe] (relay-based, 1956), the first to
  be programmed with a variable strategy and with a chance of making a mistake

Chickens have also been trained to ‘play’ the game.[@CrossOutALandmark]
[@TheChickenVanishes][@ChinatownFairIsBack] The first of these games, “Bird
Brain”, was developed in the late 1970s by Animal Behavior Enterprises, a
company founded by Marian &amp; Keller Breland, who were students of [B. F.
Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner), the behavioural
psychologist.[@TheMouseWhoReinforced  p. 73] In reality, the game is rigged—the
chicken only ever pushes a single button, and the move to be played is chosen by
a computer.[@BirdBrainManual]
