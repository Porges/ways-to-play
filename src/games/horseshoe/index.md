<p class="lead">
This is a simple blocking game for children that seems to originate from China, where it is known by many names. Because the board is shaped like the Chinese character ‘<span lang="zh">区</span>’ (‘area’), it is known as ‘<code>区</code> character game’ (<span lang="zh" class="aka">区字棋</span>, Mandarin: <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" class="aka">qū zì qí</span>). Other names include ‘crotch game’ (<span lang="zh-Hant" class="aka">褲襠棋</span>/<span lang="zh-Hans" class="aka">裤裆棋</span>, Mandarin: <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" class="aka">kùdāng qí</span>), or ‘scissor game’ (<span lang="zh" class="aka">剪刀棋</span>, Mandarin: <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" class="aka">jiǎndāo qí</span>).

The board is simple enough to be drawn with a finger into dirt or sand, and can
be played with any two sets of two distinctive pieces: rocks, shell, bottlecaps,
etc.

The Korean, Malaysian, and Thai names are probably implying a similar theme to
the game: the point of the game is to block the opponent so that their only move
is to “fall into” the river/well/bucket. The boards used in these countries also
have a circle over the ‘forbidden’ section of the board, representing the
obstacle that a piece could fall into.

This theme is also known in the Mongolian version of the game, where the circular board above is known as <span lang="mn-Latn" class="aka">temeenii tavkhai</span> (<span lang="mn-Cyrl" class="aka">тэмээний тавхай</span>/<span lang="mn-Mong" class="aka">ᠲᠡᠮᠡᢉᠡᠨ ᠦ᠋ ᠲᠠᠪᠠᠬᠠᠢ</span>) ‘camel’s paw’, and the circle is called the <span lang="mn-Latn">khudag</span> (<span lang="mn-Cyrl">худаг</span>/<span lang="mn-Mong">ᠬᠤᠳᠳᠤᠭ</span>) ‘well’. The square form of the board without a well is known as <span class="aka" lang="mn-Latn">dörvön bukh</span> (<span lang="mn-Cyrl" class="aka">дөрвөн бух</span>/<span lang="mn-Mong" class="aka">ᠳᠥᠷᠪᠡᠨ ᠪᠤᠬ</span>) ‘four bulls’.[@GamesOfMongolianShepherds p. 37–8]{%fn%}In the summary at the end of @GamesOfMongolianShepherds the game is described as if the goal is to _prevent_ the other player from entering the well, however this can’t be correct as the game does not function when played in this manner.{%endfn%}

## Play

{% image src="pong-hau-ki.svg" alt="" size="small" noborder=true %}
The initial placement of the pieces.
{% imageEnd %}

Each player has two matching pieces. The game board is set up in the initial
position as shown above. On each player’s turn, they select one of their pieces to
move into the empty position on the board. The chosen piece must move along one
of the lines on the board (or, on the boards with a  “well”, it must not move
over the circle). If a player is unable to move one of their pieces, since they
are both blocked, then they lose.
