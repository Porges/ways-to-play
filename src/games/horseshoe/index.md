This is a simple blocking game for children that seems to originate from China, where it is
known by many names. Because the board is shaped like the Chinese character
‘<span lang="zh">区</span>’ (‘area’), it is known as ‘<code>区</code> character
game’ (<span lang="zh">区字棋</span>, Mandarin: <span lang="zh-Latn">qū zì
qí</span>). Other names include ‘crotch game’ (<span lang="zh-Hant">褲襠棋</span>/<span lang="zh-Hans">裤裆棋</span>,
Mandarin: <span lang="zh-Latn">kùdāng qí</span>), or ‘scissor game’ (<span lang="zh">剪刀棋</span>,
Mandarin: <span lang="zh-Latn">jiǎndāo qí</span>). 

In Cantonese it is called ‘cleft lip game’ (<span lang="yue">崩口棋</span> <span
lang="yue-Latn">bong1 hau2 kei4</span>),[@KoreanGames p.
100][@PangHauKiImage]{%fn%}In older books (such as Culin’s) this is
transliterated as “pong hau k’i”.{%endfn%} because of the shape of the board.

In Korea it is known as <span lang="ko">우물고누</span> <span
lang="ko-Latn">umulgonu</span> ‘well game’ or <span lang="ko">강고누</span>
<span lang="ko-Latn">ganggonu</span> ‘river game’.[@KoreanGames p. 100] In
Punjabi it is called <span lang="pa-Latn">dō-guṭi</span> (TODO: possibly
<span lang="pa">ਦੋਗੁਟਿ</span>? Hindi <span language="hi">दो गुटी</span>?).[@GuptaD p. 143]

In Thailand it is reportedly called “sua tok tong” (perhaps <span
lang="th">เสือ…</span> <span lang="th-Latn">suea…</span> ‘tiger…’?).
