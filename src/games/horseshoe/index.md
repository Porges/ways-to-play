This is a simple blocking game for children that seems to originate from China, where it is
known by many names. Because the board is shaped like the Chinese character
‘<span lang="zh">区</span>’ (‘area’), it is known as ‘<code>区</code> character
game’ (<span lang="zh">区字棋</span>, Mandarin: <span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">qū zì
qí</span>). Other names include ‘crotch game’ (<span lang="zh-Hant">褲襠棋</span>/<span lang="zh-Hans">裤裆棋</span>,
Mandarin: <span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">kùdāng qí</span>), or ‘scissor game’ (<span lang="zh">剪刀棋</span>,
Mandarin: <span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">jiǎndāo qí</span>). 

The board is simple enough to be drawn with a finger into dirt or sand, and can
be played with any two sets of two distinctive pieces: rocks, shell, bottlecaps,
etc.

In English the game has no standard name, not being widespread, but it has been called
“horseshoe”, or also “bar”.[@MeditoBoxFront]

The Korean, Malaysian, and Thai names are probably implying a similar theme to
the game: the point of the game is to block the opponent so that their only move
is to “fall into” the river/well/bucket. The boards used in these countries also
have a circle over the ‘forbidden’ section of the board, representing the
obstacle that a piece could fall into.

## Play

{% image src="pong-hau-ki.svg" alt="" size="small" %}
The initial placement of the pieces.
{% imageEnd %}

Each player has two matching pieces. The game board is set up in the initial
position as shown above. On each player’s turn, they select one of their pieces to
move into the empty position on the board. The chosen piece must move along one
of the lines on the board (or, on the boards with a  “well”, it must not move
over the circle). If a player is unable to move one of their pieces, since they
are both blocked, then they lose.
