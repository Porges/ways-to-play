<p class="lead">
<span class="aka noun" lang="wo">Yoote</span> is a strategic boardgame for two players from Senegal.
</p>

Many existing sources use the spelling <span class="aka noun" lang="fr">Yoté</span>, which seems to be the French interpretation of the Wolof word. The <i>o</i> is long according to @VolofFrancais [379], @WolofFrancais [409], as well as in evidence from native speakers online. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolofal_alphabet">Wolofal</a> it is written <span lang="wo-Arab" class="aka">يࣸوتࣺ</span> (or in older orthography <span lang="wo-Arab" class="aka">يࣸوتٜ</span>) <span lang="wo-Latn" class="aka noun">yóoté</span> — see its appearance in the <cite>Poem of the First Màggal</cite> by the Wolof poet Serigne Mor Kayre (1869–1951).[@PoemFirstMaggal]
