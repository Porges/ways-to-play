<Pronounce noun="true" lang="ja-Latn"  file="pronunciation_ja_八八.mp3" pronouncer="mezashi">Hachi-Hachi</Pronounce> (<span lang="ja">八八</span>, ‘88’) is the preëminent [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>](/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/) gambling game for 3–7 players. In many old English sources it is considered synonymous with ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span>’ or ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</span>’ and isn’t given a more specific name.

Ref: [@Hanafuda, p. 39] @Gimmi88 @HachiHachi @PlayingHanaKaruta

The name derives from the objective of the game; the standard version of the game is for three active players, and there are 264 total card points available, so the goal for each player is to obtain at least their share, i.e. 264 ÷ 3 = **88** points.

Despite being — historically, at least —  the most important <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> game, it is also one of the most difficult. The play of the cards is the same as in other <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> games, but the procedures of betting and payment combine to increase the complexity. There are also multiple sets of <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span>, and specialized equipment that was commonly used with the game.

> [!todo]
> Because of this, I present a simplified base game first, and each subsequent section introduces another extension of the rules until the full version of the game is attained.[^zds] As a game that was often played in secret for money, there is no one ‘true’ set of rules, and there are also many optional variations and regional rules differences.

## Rules

### <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yaku</span> &bull; <span lang="ja">役</span>

The <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hachi-Hachi</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> are divided into two categories: <span lang="ja-Latn">te&shy;yaku</span> (<span lang="ja">手役</span> ‘hand combinations’), which are combinations that are found in the dealt hands, and <span lang="ja-Latn">deki&shy;yaku</span> (<span lang="ja">出役</span> ‘coming-out combinations’), which are combinations that are captured during play.

#### <span lang="ja-Latn">Te&shy;yaku</span> &bull; <span lang="ja">手役</span> 

> [!aside]
>
> Many traditional rulesets give the list of <span lang="ja-Latn">te&shy;yaku</span> in one group, with all possible combinations and their scores listed. When presented in this way there are seemingly 53 <span lang="ja-Latn">te&shy;yaku</span>! It is much simpler to remember two smaller sets of <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> and to recognize that when scoring for two <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span>, the total score is simply the sum of each individual score.
>
> However, in some extremely rare cases, I have seen rulesets where the scoring is not a simple linear combination. In this case, recourse to a lookup chart is required.

The <span lang="ja-Latn">te&shy;yaku</span> can be divided into two sets. The first set is based upon having sets of cards in the same month, and the second set is based upon having a large number of 1-point (<span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span>) cards.  A player can score one combination in each set; they should pick the highest-scoring combination.

Note that in many ways the <span lang="ja-Latn">te&shy;yaku</span> combinations should be considered _compensation_ for having a hand that is hard to win with, rather than a straightforward “winning combination” as in Texas Hold’em. As an example, a hand that has two pairs of three can only capture a maximum of three cards that are not already contained in the hand.

Combinations based upon sets:

<dl>

<dt><span lang="ja-Latn">sanbon</span> &bull; <span lang="ja">三本 (さんぼん)</span> &bull; three-of-a-kind/3</dt>
<dd>Three cards of the same month.</dd>

<dt><span lang="ja-Latn">tate&shy;sanbon</span> &bull; <span lang="ja">立三本 (たてさんぼん)</span> &bull; special three-of-a-kind/3*</dt>
<dd>
Three cards of the months of Wisteria, Iris, Bush Clover, or the three <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> of Paulownia.
This is worth more because these months cannot contribute towards the <span lang="ja-Latn">aka-tan</span> or <span lang="ja-Latn">ao-tan</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">dekiyaku</span>, so this form has a higher compensation.[^fn0]

</dd>
</dl>

Thus, the highest-scoring hand possible has both <span lang="ja-Latn">shi&shy;sō</span> and <span lang="ja-Latn">karasu</span>; there is only one way this hand can be formed, giving it a 1-in-73&#x202f;629&#x202f;072 chance of occurring! Even ordinary <span lang="ja-Latn">shi&shy;sō</span> has a mere 1-in-139&#x202f;449 chance of being dealt, and when this happens it is a common house rule that the round is instantly won by the player who receives such a hand; some sources suggest that the deck should then be burned.

The overall number of possible hands with combinations from each set of <span lang="ja-Latn">te&shy;yaku</span> are as follows. Each cell indicates the number of possible hands which contain both the given ‘set’ and <span lang="ja-Latn">‘kasu’ yaku</span>, as well as the overall probability (many entries round to zero). By inverting the probability of the top-left entry, we can see that a <span lang="ja-Latn">te&shy;yaku</span> is expected in about 1-in-4 dealt hands.

## The <span lang="ja-Latn">Yaku</span> in Depth

### <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Aka-tan</span> &bull; <span lang="ja">赤短</span> &bull; “red ribbons”

This <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> is made up of exactly the three red <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> cards of the first three months (pine, plum, cherry). No other <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> may be used to complete it.

The cards are labelled <span lang="ja">𛀋らす</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">urasu</span>), <span lang="ja">よろし</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">yoroshi</span>), and <span lang="ja">す𛀙𛂦ら</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">sugawara</span>).

It was also formerly known as <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn"  file="pronunciation_ja_裏菅原.mp3" pronouncer="mezashi">ura-sugawara</Pronounce> (<span lang="ja">裏菅原</span>, ‘behind/inside <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Sugawara</span>’) or <span lang="ja-Latn">urasu</span> for short.[^fn10] This name was a reference to the popular <span lang="ja-Latn">kabuki</span> play <cite><Pronounce lang="ja-Latn"  file="pronunciation_ja_菅原伝授手習鑑.mp3" pronouncer="jinyamai">Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami</Pronounce></cite> (<span lang="ja">菅原伝授手習鑑</span>, ‘<cite>Sugawara and the Secrets of Calligraphy</cite>’). In the play the three main characters are brothers who are named after the three plants featured on the cards: <Pronounce noun="true" lang="ja-Latn"  pronouncer="mezashi" file="pronunciation_ja_松王丸.mp3">Matsuōmaru</Pronounce> (<span lang="ja">松王丸</span>, pine), <Pronounce noun="true" lang="ja-Latn"  pronouncer="mezashi" file="pronunciation_ja_梅王丸.mp3">Umeōmaru</Pronounce> (<span lang="ja">梅王丸</span>, plum), and <Pronounce noun="true" lang="ja-latn"  file="pronunciation_ja_桜丸.mp3" pronouncer="mezashi">Sakuramaru</Pronounce> (<span lang="ja">桜丸</span>, cherry). In the play the brothers wear costumes which bear symbols of the plants related to their names.

[^fn10]: Other spellings of <span lang="ja-Latn">urasu</span> (<span lang="ja">うらす</span>) include <span lang="ja">裏</span>, <span lang="ja">裏す</span>, <span lang="ja">宇良す</span>, or <span lang="ja">𛀋らす</span>.

The <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> can also be called <span lang="ja-Latn">yoroshī</span> (<span lang="ja">よろしい</span>, ‘good’) or <span lang="ja-Latn">akayoro</span> (<span lang="ja">赤よろ</span>, ‘red good’), or even simply <span lang="ja-Latn">aka</span> (<span lang="ja">緋</span>, ‘scarlet’), although this risks confusion with the <span lang="ja-Latn">aka teyaku</span>.

## Equipment

### <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kashifuda</span> &bull; <span lang="ja">菓子札</span> &bull; “sweets cards”

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kashifuda</span> are cards that are used to stand in for money, since playing gambling games for real money has almost always been illegal in Japan. The name means ‘sweets cards’, but is also a pun on <span lang="ja">貸し</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">kashi</span> (‘debt/favour’), so can be understood as ‘debt cards’. I think the name was originally probably meant to be the latter but was later modified into the current form. In any case, the cards usually show pictures of food and drink.

It is unclear how literally the images should be taken — did a card depicting a steak dinner require the loser to make payment in kind? It is fun to imagine so, but I have no evidence to support this.

At top left, two 25-<span lang="ja-Latn">kan</span> notes, the left one reading <span lang="ja">小鯛雀𛁋し</span> (‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kodai Suzume</span> sushi’), a sushi restaurant [that opened in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōsaka</span> in 1781, and apparently a favourite of Emperor <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</span>](http://www.sushiman.co.jp/company/); the other reads <span lang="ja">上等蒸菓子</span> (‘fine steamed confectionary’). The two 50-<span lang="ja-Latn">kan</span> cards (top right, bottom left) are for <span lang="ja">洋食</span> (‘Western meal’) and <span lang="ja">上等葡萄酒</span> (‘fine wine’). The reverse of the cards is designed to look like a <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</span>-era 1-yen banknote that bore a portrait of the [Empress <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Jingū</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Jing%C5%AB), and which was used from 1881 until 1899. The set also contained (not pictured here) another 50-<span lang="ja-Latn">kan</span> card and a 100-<span lang="ja-Latn">kan</span> card. {/*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/644611492846632960/702040093140975687/i-img800x600-1587393965cq878p755785.png*/}
