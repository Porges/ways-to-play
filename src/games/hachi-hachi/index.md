<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hachi-Hachi</span> (<span lang="ja">八八</span>, ‘88’) is
the preëminent [<span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>](/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/) gambling game for 3–7 players.
In many old English sources it is considered synonymous with ‘<span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span>’ or ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</span>’ and
isn’t given a more specific name.

Ref: [@Hanafuda, p. 39]

The name derives from the objective of the game; the standard version of the
game is for three active players, and there are 264 total card points available,
so the goal for each player is to obtain at least their share, i.e. 264 ÷ 3 =
**88** points.

Despite being — historically, at least —  the most important <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> game, it is also one of the most difficult. The
play of the cards is the same as in other <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>
games, but the procedures of betting and payment combine to increase the
complexity. There are also multiple sets of <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span>,
and specialized equipment that was commonly used with the game.

<!-- 
{/*
<p>Because of this, I present a simplified base game first, and each subsequent section introduces another extension of the rules until the full version of the game is attained.<Footnote>This approach was inspired by Z.D. Smith’s “<a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/posts/a-curriculum-of-vira.html">A Curriculum of Vira</a>”.</Footnote> As a game that was often played in secret for money, there is no one ‘true’ set of rules, and there are also many optional variations and regional rules differences.</p>

## Rules

## The <span lang="ja-Latn">Yaku</span> in Depth

### <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Aka-tan</span> &bull; <span lang="ja">赤短</span> &bull; “red ribbons”

This <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> is made up of exactly the three red <span
lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> cards of the first three months (pine, plum,
cherry). No other <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> may be used to complete
it.

The cards that form the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Aka-tan/Ura-Sugawara</span> <span

Gyokusuidō</span>](/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/traditional-manufacturers/#tanaka-gyokusuido)
deck. The cards are labelled <span lang="ja">𛀋らす</span> (<span
lang="ja-Latn">urasu</span>), <span lang="ja">よろし</span> (<span
lang="ja-Latn">yoroshi</span>), and <span lang="ja">す𛀙𛂦ら</span> (<span
lang="ja-Latn">sugawara</span>).

It was also formerly known as <span lang="ja-Latn">ura-sugawara</span> (<span
lang="ja">裏菅原</span>, ‘behind/inside <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Sugawara</span>’)
or <span lang="ja-Latn">urasu</span> for short.<Footnote>Other spellings of
<span lang="ja-Latn">urasu</span> (<span lang="ja">うらす</span>) include <span
lang="ja">裏</span>, <span lang="ja">裏す</span>, <span lang="ja">宇良す</span>,
or <span lang="ja">𛀋らす</span>.</Footnote> This name was a reference to the
popular <span lang="ja-Latn">kabuki</span> play <cite lang="ja-Latn">Sugawara
Denju Tenarai Kagami</cite> (<span lang="ja">菅原伝授手習鑑</span>,
‘<cite>Sugawara and the Secrets of Calligraphy</cite>’). In the play the three
main characters are brothers who are named after the three plants featured on
the cards: <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsuōmaru</span> (<span lang="ja">松王丸
</span>, pine), <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Umeōmaru</span> (<span lang="ja">梅王丸
</span>, plum), and <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Sakuramaru</span> (<span lang="ja">桜丸
</span>, cherry). In the play the brothers wear costumes which bear symbols of
the plants related to their names.

The <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> can also be called <span
lang="ja-Latn">yoroshī</span> (<span lang="ja">よろしい</span>, ‘good’) or <span
lang="ja-Latn">akayoro</span> (<span lang="ja">赤よろ</span>, ‘red good’), or
even simply <span lang="ja-Latn">aka</span> (<span lang="ja">緋</span>,
‘scarlet’), although this risks confusion with the <span lang="ja-Latn">aka
teyaku</span>.

## Equipment

### <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kashifuda</span> &bull; <span lang="ja">菓子札</span> &bull; “sweets cards”

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kashifuda</span> are cards that are used to stand in for
money, since playing gambling games for real money has almost always been
illegal in Japan. The name means ‘sweets cards’, but is also a pun on <span
lang="ja">貸し</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">kashi</span> (‘debt/favour’), so can
be understood as ‘debt cards’. I think the name was originally probably meant to
be the latter but was later modified into the current form. In any case, the
cards usually show pictures of food and drink.

It is unclear how literally the images should be taken — did a card depicting a
steak dinner require the loser to make payment in kind? It is fun to imagine so,
but I have no evidence to support this.
