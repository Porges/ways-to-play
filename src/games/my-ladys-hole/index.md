Some references, such as that in the song <cite>(Commodities of) The New Exchange</cite> from {%c%} 1615, must refer to the bowling game:

> Here is a set of kitle pins,<br>
>  & boules at them to roule ;<br>
> & if you like such thundering spourt,<br>
>  Here is my ladys hole.[@MerrySongsAndBallads5 p. 4]

It appears to also have been called <span class="aka">Hole</span>, as that name appears in a list of card games in @TaylorsMotto.

The sexual nature of the name is punned upon in @MysteriesOfLoveAndEloquence (1685):

> Q: What game do men love best?
> 
> A: My Ladies-hole.
>
> Q: What sport doth women like best?
>
> A: Push pin.

An early definitive reference to the card game is in 1708:

> For if an earneſt Look, an amorous Ogle, or a familiar Smile, are but mutually adminiſter’d by any Gentleman and Lady to each other, ſhe will certainly ſuſpect, and as readily report, that a Game at my Lady’s Hole, in a little Time, will be play’d between them ; for that ſhe could ſee, by their Eyes, they were both ready to lift for Deal the very firſt Opportunity.[@AdamAndEve p. 24]

[Mary Pendarves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Delany) mentions playing the game in a letter of October 27th, 1732:

> We got early into our inn, played at my lady’s hole, supped, and went early to bed.[@Pendarves1]

[Henry Seymour Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Seymour_Conway) alluded to the game in a letter to [Horace Walpole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Walpole) dated January 19th, 1741 (OS):<!-- also, Comet -->

> For I seem to be playing at the noble amusement of my Lady’s hole, where I always have the good luck to get a king for an ace.[@YaleWalpole37 p. 86]

This proves one of few clues to how the game was played; evidently cards might be exchanged.

also in [@FannyBurney]

It is denounced (alongside {%gameref laugh-and-lie-down %}) as seeming “compos’d on Purpoſe to ſhock the Modeſty” in 1754.[@SeriousReflections p. 13]

In 1784, it was already being referred to as “old-fashioned”,[@ObservationsOnSomeOldFashionedGames]{%fn%}This is a later adaptation of the piece in @ALetterFromALady/@ALetterFromMrsMidnight.{%endfn%} but also appears that year in a humorous tract.[@APublicansReason]
