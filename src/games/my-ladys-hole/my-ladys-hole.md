<p class="lead"><span class="aka">My Lady’s Hole</span> was an English card game popular during the 18th century.</p>

This article is about the card game; the term could also be used to refer to {%
gameref trou-madame %} (also known as nine-holes), as well as being used in its obvious vulgar sense — in 1754 it was denounced (alongside {%gameref laugh-and-lie-down %}) as seeming “compos’d on Purpoſe to ſhock the Modeſty”.[@SeriousReflections p. 13]

It also has apparently been called simply “<span class="aka">Hole</span>”, as that name appears in a list of card games in {%a john-taylor %}.[@TaylorsMotto]

Some references, such as that in the song <cite>(Commodities of) The New Exchange</cite> from <abbr>c.</abbr> 1615, must obviously refer to the bowling game:[@MerrySongsAndBallads5 p. 4]

> Here is a set of kitle pins,<br/>
> &emsp;& boules at them to roule ;<br/>
> & if you like such thundering spourt,<br/>
> &emsp;Here is my ladys hole.

## History

The sexual nature of the name is punned upon in @MysteriesOfLoveAndEloquence (1685), although this could be a reference to the bowling game:

> Q: What game do men love best?
> 
> A: My Ladies-hole.
>
> Q: What sport doth women like best?
>
> A: Push pin.

An early definitive reference to the card game is in 1708:

> For if an earneſt Look, an amorous Ogle, or a familiar Smile, are but mutually adminiſter’d by any Gentleman and Lady to each other, ſhe will certainly ſuſpect, and as readily report, that a Game at my Lady’s Hole, in a little Time, will be play’d between them ; for that ſhe could ſee, by their Eyes, they were both ready to lift for Deal the very firſt Opportunity.[@AdamAndEve p. 24]

[Mary Pendarves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Delany) mentions playing the game in a letter of October 27th, 1732:

> We got early into our inn, played at my lady’s hole, supped, and went early to bed.[@Pendarves1]

As does [Fanny Burney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Burney)  in her journal entry referring to 29th March, 1770 (although she later self-censored the name of the game).[@FannyBurney 121]

In 1784, it was already being referred to as “old-fashioned”,[@ObservationsOnSomeOldFashionedGames][^fn0] but also appears that year in a humorous tract.[@APublicansReason]

[^fn0]: This is a later adaptation of the piece in @ALetterFromALady/@ALetterFromMrsMidnight.

## Identification

There are very few clues to how the game was played, and as far as I know, no explicit lists of rules anywhere. The sole clue to the identification of this game is in a footnote in a 1792 pamphlet on the game of Put, which states that Ladies’s Hole is “Vulgarly called Whehee”.[@PuttMockHeroic 10] (The rules to {%gameref whehee %} are described on that page.)

There are other vague allusions to the rules which also support this identification. [Henry Seymour Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Seymour_Conway) reference the game in a letter to [Horace Walpole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Walpole) dated January 19th, 1741 (OS):{/* also, Comet */}

> For I seem to be playing at the noble amusement of my Lady’s hole, where I always have the good luck to get a king for an ace.[@YaleWalpole37 p. 86]

According to this, cards would be exchanged. However, the rank of the cards is not a counting feature in Whehee — unless rank is perhaps used to break ties — so the metaphor here may not be entirely accurate.

The other clue is in the 1692 book <cite>The Post-Boy Robbed of his Mail</cite>, which contains a letter “From a Bawd that desires a Habitation for the Exercise of her Profession”:[@PostBoyRobd 278]

> The women also have their dispatches, and to speak the Truth to a Man that understands […]rap, a double Card plays best at my Lady’s Hole.

Having a double card would indeed be an advantage for {%gameref whehee%}, as the holder would only need to obtain one more card of the same suit to win.

The 1734 book @TryalOfSkill [5] also includes — again in a footnote — another term related to the game:

> _Sipping_, or the Word _Sip_, is used when the Person wants but one Moveal to _get into_ My Lady’s-Hole.

This might have worked similarly to the announcement in the modern game of “last card”.
