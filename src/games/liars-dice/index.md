<p class="lead"><span class="aka">Liar’s Dice</span> (originally <span class="aka">Liar Dice</span>, rarely <span class="aka">Lying Dice</span> or <span class="aka">Lie Dice</span>) is a game that has been played for many years and in many variations. At the end of the 20th century it spawned a number of commercial variations. The original game is usually described as a two-player game, but can be extended to any number of players, although with too many it loses appeal.</p>

## History

<!--
The earliest references I have found are often from British sources who believe the game to be of Chinese or perhaps other Asian origin — it is reported to be played at many outposts in British colonies — but as of yet I do not know of a true Chinese or other source of the game.
-->

<!--
However, the very first reference I have found is in the novel @ABurntOutCase [p. 153], which is set in a location on the upper Congo river.

1916: https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.150016/page/n159/mode/2up?q=%22liar+dice%22

No! This is 1961, and the book is incorrectly printed!
-->

The earliest reference to the game I have found is from 1934, when the game appeared in the famous American [Harry’s New York Bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry%27s_New_York_Bar) in Paris. At this time it was already described as a game that had “long […] been popular in the Far East”.[@AmericanBarsInParis] In this version it is described as a game for two players, played with poker dice.

In 1936, it is mentioned in the Philippines,[@SportsInTheOrient] and by 1939 reported in Des Moines, Iowa.[@GeorgeSherriff] In that year a novel titled <cite>Liar Dice</cite> was published. This was a detective story set in [Tianjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin), written by a man who had previously worked in the city.[@LiarDiceMoser]

Mentions of the game begin to pick up after this: in 1940 the British golf team played it with the Japanese team in Shanghai,[@JapanBeatsBritanAtGolf] while British tobacconist [Richard Dobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dobson_(businessman)) also reported it at the Shanghai Country Club.[@ChinaCycle p. 176] In the same year it is mentioned as being played by locals at Cebu in the Philippines.[@CrossWindsOfEmpire p. 176] In 1941 it is reported at US Air Force bases on Midway and Wake Islands,[@TheBreretonDiaries p. 14, 16] and it seems to have become particularly associated with air force members on both sides of the Atlantic: a 1942 biography of Air Marshal [Arthur Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Harris) even claims that he invented the game.[@CurrentBiography1942 p. 334] It was also popular in the army — in 1946 Harris’ counterpart{%fn%}Harris was promoted to Marshal of the Royal Air Force in 1946.{%endfn%} Field Marshal [Viscount Montgomery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Montgomery) is described as teaching the “British game” to Americans.[@MontyRollsBones] In 1951, at the same time that Montgomery was Deputy to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe,{%fn%}At that time, [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower).{%endfn%} the Air Deputy was Air Marshal [Hugh Saunders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Saunders_(RAF_officer)), who was also said to have “phenomenal luck” at Liar’s Dice.[@PhenomenalLuck]

It was also popular with journalists, appearing in 1940 across [Kuching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuching),[@ActionInTheEast p. 20] Singapore,[@SettingSunOfJapan p. 209] and in 1942 in a fictional Tokyo.[@YearOfWrath p. 52] 

In 1942, one writer stated that “anyone who has spent some time in China or the Philippines” would know of the game, while their correspondent described some restrictions on the game: that only one number of dice could be altered, and that following players must use the same number of throws.[@GallopingIvories]

At the end of WW2 the game begins to appear in reference works for the first time, at first in the 1944 @ModernHoyle1944 [p. 235], where it is described as “very popular in the United States Army”. The instructions describe the two-player game with a screen, as in the earliest 1934 reference.
