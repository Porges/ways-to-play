<p class="lead">
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Oicho-Kabu</span> (<span lang="ja">おいちょかぶ</span>, ‘eight-nine’) is a Japanese gambling game in the style of Baccarat.

The game originated in Japan, but has surprisingly also been seen played amongst Aboriginal communities in the northern parts of Australia — particularly by [Larrakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larrakia_people) people around Darwin — , apparently having been transferred there by Japanese sailors working in the pearl industry.[@NoteOnAMissingLink][@CardGamesAmongAborigines] A <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> advertising poster from the early 20th century also indicates that their cards were being exported to Australia.  In Australia the game was played with standard “international” playing cards.

The same game was reported under the name <span lang="pis">kura</span> in the Solomon Islands in the 1970s,[@EthnographicPsychology p. 271]{%fn%}The word also seems to apply to gambling in general.{%endfn%} and it is still played there to this day.[@IllegalCardGamesToBeBanned]

In Papua New Guinea it is known as <span lang="tpi">kawu</span> — clearly derived from the Japanese name.[@ThreeMoreNewGuineanCardGames p. 54]{%fn%}It is worth noting that in the article @ThreeMoreNewGuineanCardGames the author’s informant definitely knows more about the history of the game; it is not “almost certainly European in origin”!{%endfn%} Further versions of this game — of which there are many — are called <span lang="tpi">laki</span> (‘lucky’),[@ThreeNativeCardGames p. 50] and some variants are described below.  More extreme variations are described in their own article.

## Equipment

The game in Japan is played with special cards called <span lang="ja-Latn">kabufuda</span> (<span lang="ja">株札</span>, ‘<span lang="ja-Latn">kabu</span> cards’), which are numbered from 1–10. A full deck is 40 cards, and has four copies of each card.

It can also be played with <span lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> cards (by dropping two months),{%fn%}There are also <span lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> decks with only 10 months, called <span lang="ja-Latn">mushifuda</span>. These lack the 6th &amp; 7th months of the standard deck.{%endfn%} or with all of the {% cards 'A–10' %} from a standard deck of playing cards.

{% imageEnd %}

## Play

Up to ten people can play the game (aside from the dealer).

The goal of the game is to get a card total as close to 9 as possible. The total is calculated by summing the values of the cards in a player’s hand. Card totals equal to or over 10 have their first digit discarded (i.e. the sum is calculated modulo ten), so that a total of 10 is equivalent to zero, and a total of 12 equivalent to two.

In addition, a hand of three cards of the same rank is an automatic win. This hand is called  {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn" word="arashi" file="pronunciation_ja_嵐.mp3" pronouncer="straycat88" %} (<span lang="ja">嵐 </span> ‘storm’) or <span lang="ja-Latn">zoro</span> (<span lang="ja">揃</span> ‘set’).

The dealer shuffles the cards and deals two cards to each player including themselves, the first face-up, the second face-down. Each player looks at their cards and may then request a third if they wish. A common rule is that a player *must* ask for another card if their total is 3 or less, and *may not* ask for another card if their total is 7 or more.

Once all players have decided whether or not to receive a third card, all cards are revealed. Players who have beaten the dealer’s total win, and the others lose.

The dealer also wins if their first card was a {%cards 4%} or {%cards 9%} and their second card was a {%cards 1%}. This beats any hand including a triple. The combination {%cards 41%} is called <span lang="ja-Latn">shippin</span> (<span lang="ja">シッピン</span>) and {%cards 91%} is called <span lang="ja-Latn">kuppin</span> (<span lang="ja">クッピン</span>).

If both dealer and player have a triple, the higher triple wins.

### Other Combinations

As with all living card games, there are many local variations.

In the [<cite>Yakuza</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)) video game series, there are two special hands:

* A hand with {%cards '10 10 1'%}, in any order, wins 20× the stake.
* A player who is dealt the two cards {%cards '4 6'%}, in any order, may choose
  to turn in their cards and keep their stake, instead of playing out the round.

## Terminology

The hand totals are counted with special gambling-specific numbers. Some of these — like the playing cards themselves — are derived from Portuguese:

### Named hands

In the past, some combinations of hands totalling 9 (<span lang="ja-Latn">kabu</span>) were named. In the erotic book <cite>Lustful Plum Blossom Fence</cite> (<cite lang="ja">好色梅花垣</cite>, date unknown to me), the following names were given. The meaning of most of the names is obscure.[@EbashiKabuCarta]

* {%cards '153'%} ‘royal nine’ (<span lang="ja">御かぶ</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">o&shy;kabu</span>)
* {%cards '234'%} ‘ascending nine’ (<span lang="ja">のぼりがぶ</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">nobori&shy;kabu</span>){%fn%}i.e. <span lang="ja">上り</span> — not, as Japanese Wikipedia has, [<span lang="ja">幟</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobori).{%endfn%} — this is the only obvious name
* {%cards '333'%} ‘newly-born imperial prince/new shrine nine’ (<span lang="ja">今みやがぶ</span>)
* {%cards '559'%} ??? (<span lang="ja">でつくがぶ</span>)
* {%cards '757'%} ‘two card imperial archivist protection nine’ (<span lang="ja">二条蔵人あいごがぶ</span>) — the position of the head of the “imperial archivists” (<span lang="ja">蔵人頭</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">kurōdo</span> or <span lang="ja-Latn">kurando no tō</span>, usually translated ‘head chamberlain’) was held by two people, who were personally selected by the Emperor
* {%cards '883'%} ‘thunder nine’ (<span lang="ja">雷公がぶ</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">raikō gabu</span>) — named after a [Chinese god of thunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigong)

Similarly, in the <span lang="ja-Latn">bunraku/kabuki</span> play <cite>Ōtō-no-Miya and the Armor of the Rising Sun</cite> (<cite lang="ja">大塔宮曦鎧</cite>), staged for the first time in 1723, other names are given for the zero-scoring hands:[@EdoKaruta7]

* {%cards '668'%} ‘<span lang="ja-Latn">hitsuhari</span> pig’ (<span lang="ja">ひつはりぶた</span>)
* {%cards '893'%} ‘<span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Kamakura</span> pig’ (<span lang="ja">鎌倉ぶた</span>)

### “<span lang="ja-Latn">Yakuza</span>”

{%aside%}
An interesting coincidence pointed out by Ryan Sartor is that when translated to the <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Hanafuda</span> deck (with which the game could also be played), the card values {%cards 893 %} correspond to the following card combination (<span lang="ja">役</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span>), which is named <span lang="ja-Latn">nomi</span> (<span lang="ja">飲み</span> ‘drinking’), and is used in several <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Hanafuda</span> games:
{%image src="../../articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/Hanafuda_8-1.svg;../../articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/Hanafuda_9-1.svg;../../articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/Hanafuda_3-1.svg" alt="a card showing the full moon;a card showing a sake cup;a card showing cherry blossoms" size="small" justify="centered"

A hand that sums to zero is the worst possible hand. The name of one of these hands — that comprising the 8, 9, and 3 cards — will be familiar to many English-speakers today as the word used for Japanese gangsters, <span lang="ja-Latn">yakuza</span>. The name is a straightforward reading (one of several possible) of the numbers <span lang="ja">八九三</span> (893), and, before being applied to gangsters, was a term derived from the <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Oicho-Kabu</span> hand which also meant “useless” or “good-for-nothing”. 

The term has been used in this way for a long time; it appears in the <span lang="ja-Latn">bunraku</span> (and later <span lang="ja-Latn">kabuki</span>) play <span lang="ja-Latn">Wada Gassen Onna Maizuru</span> (<cite lang="ja">和田 合戦女舞鶴</cite> ‘Wada Battle Female Dancing Crane’),{%fn%}The dancing crane (<span lang="ja-Latn">maizuru</span>) was the <span lang="ja-Latn">mon</span> of a standard <span lang="ja-Latn">kabuki</span> character based upon [<span lang="ja-Latn">Asahina Yoshihide</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asahina_Yoshihide); thus, the title promised a female version of this character.{%endfn%} first performed in 1736:

<blockquote lang="ja" class="blockquote">
エエ埒もない<ruby>八九三<rp>(</rp><rt>ヤクザ</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>の<ruby>眶 <rp>(</rp><rt>まぶた</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>に出合うて
</blockquote>

This term was adopted by gamblers as a nickname and eventually became the standard term for a Japanese gangster.

As to _why_ this particular hand was chosen, there are several options. Note that it is not the only hand that sums to zero; there are 22 such hands.  However, it is the only hand containing an {%cards 8%} and a {%cards 9%} that results in a zero score; thus if the name of the game is “8, 9…” it is naturally followed by “3”.

## History

Possibly the game was originally called the ‘three card’ (<span lang="ja">三枚</span>) game.

## Variants

### Kabu

This is a simplified variant by [Sid Sackson](/articles/people/sid-sackson/), for 2–6 players, described in @CardGamesAroundTheWorld [p. 12].

Play with the {% cards 'A–⑩' %} from a standard deck of cards. You will also need some chips to keep track of score. Sids’ suggested chip distribution for each player is:

<table class="table numeric table-sm">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Players</th>
        <th>1 pt<br />(White)</th>
        <th>5 pt<br />(Red)</th>
        <th>10 pt<br />(Blue)</th>
        <th>Total Points</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class="table-group-divider">
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">2</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>40</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">3</th>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>55</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">4</th>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>70</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">5</th>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>85</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">6</th>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>100</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Shuffle and deal two cards face-down to each player. Each player looks at their cards and may then request a third, and subsequently a fourth card.

The goal, as in standard <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Oicho-Kabu</span>, is to get a total as close to 9 as possible, discarding 10s.

After all players have finished requesting new cards, the hands are revealed.  Each player collects the difference from their hand to players with a lower count, and pays the different from their hand to players with a higher count.

The game ends when a player is unable to pay their debts as they have run out of chips. They do not pay any of their remaining chips. Whoever has the most points is the winner.

**Variant:** in addition to dealing to the players, deal 6 cards face-up to the table. These cards are out of play but give the players more information about the cards remaining in the deck.
