<p class="lead"><span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Oicho-Kabu</span> (<span lang="ja">おいちょかぶ</span>,
‘eight-nine’) is a Japanese gambling game in the style of Baccarat.</p>

<!-- excerpt -->

The game originated in Japan, but has surprisingly also been seen played amongst
Aboriginal communities in the northern parts of Australia, apparently having
been transferred there by Japanese sailors working in the pearl
industry.[@NoteOnAMissingLink][@CardGamesAmongAborigines] A <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> advertising poster from the early 20th century
also indicates that their cards were being exported to Australia. In Australia
the game is played with standard “international” playing cards.

## Equipment

The game in Japan is played with special cards called <span
lang="ja-Latn">kabufuda</span> (<span lang="ja">株札</span>, ‘<span
lang="ja-Latn">kabu</span> cards’), which are numbered from 1–10. A full deck is
40 cards, and has four copies of each card. It can also be played with <span
lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> cards (by dropping two months),{%fn%}There are
also <span lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> decks with only 10 months, called
<span lang="ja-Latn">mushifuda</span>. These lack the 6th &amp; 7th months of
the standard deck.{%endfn%} or with the {% cards 'A–10' %} from a standard deck
of playing cards.

## Play

Up to ten people can play the game (aside from the dealer).

The dealer shuffles the cards and deals two cards face-down to each player. Each
player looks at their cards and may then request a third, and subsequently a
fourth card.

The goal of the game is to get a card total as close to 9 as possible. The total
is calculated by summing the values of the cards in a player’s hand. Card totals
equal to or over ten have their first digit discarded (i.e. the sum is calculated
modulo ten), so that a total of 10 is equivalent to zero, and a total of 12
equivalent to two.


## Terminology

The hand totals are counted with special gambling-specific numbers. Some of
these — like the playing cards themselves — are derived from Portuguese:

## Variants

### Kabu

This is a simplified variant by [Sid Sackson](/articles/people/sid-sackson/), for 2–6 players, described in
@CardGamesAroundTheWorld [p. 12].

Play with the {% cards 'A–⑩' %} from a standard deck of cards. You will also
need some chips to keep track of score. Sids’ suggested chip distribution for
each player is:

<table class="table numeric">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Players</th>
        <th>1 pt<br />(White)</th>
        <th>5 pt<br />(Red)</th>
        <th>10 pt<br />(Blue)</th>
        <th>Total Points</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">2</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>40</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">3</th>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>55</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">4</th>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>70</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">5</th>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>85</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row" class="text-center">6</th>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>100</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Shuffle and deal two cards face-down to each player. Each player looks at their
cards and may then request a third, and subsequently a fourth card.

The goal, as in standard <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Oicho-Kabu</span>, is to get a
total as close to 9 as possible, discarding 10s.

After all players have finished requesting new cards, the hands are revealed.
Each player collects the difference from their hand to players with a lower
count, and pays the different from their hand to players with a higher count.

The game ends when a player is unable to pay their debts as they have run out of
chips. They do not pay any of their remaining chips. Whoever has the most points
is the winner.

**Variant:** in addition to dealing to the players, deal 6 cards
face-up to the table. These cards are out of play but give the players more
information about the cards remaining in the deck.
