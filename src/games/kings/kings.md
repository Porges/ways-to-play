<span class="aka">Kings</span> is a luck-based card game from New Guinea. It plays similarly to a fishing game, only there are no decisions to be made.

The description below is based upon @ThreeNativeCardGames [p. 52–3].

## Play

The game is played with a standard 52-card deck. 

To begin, the four <Cards>K</Cards> are removed and set aside. These cards are not
used for playing but as scoring tokens.

The dealer shuffles the remaining 48 cards and deals four cards face up to a
pool in the centre. If any of them can be paired (by rank) the dealer captures
these and deals replacements, and does this until there are no pairs in the
centre. The rest of the deck is placed face-down next to the pool to form a
stock.

Each player then takes their turn in the following way: they turn up two more
cards from the stock and add them to the pool. If there are any pairs they
capture them, and then play passes to the next player.

Once all the cards have been played (and thus captured), the player with the
most captured cards wins a <Cards>K</Cards>. If there is a tie between players
then a single round of [Laki](games/laki/laki.md) can be played to determine who gets
the <Cards>K</Cards>.

The cards (aside from the <Cards>K</Cards>s) are then collected and shuffled and the game is played again, until all the <Cards>K</Cards>s have been claimed. The player with the most <Cards>K</Cards>s is the winner. Again, if there is a tie between players then a single round of [Laki](games/laki/laki.md) can be played to determine the overall winner.

> The shortening of the deck to 48 cards makes me wonder if this is a game derived from a Japanese source, as there are other games played in New Guinea which do have a known Japanese origin. A [Hanafuda](articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/hanafuda.md) deck has (12×4=) 48 cards in it, and the gameplay of Kings is remniscent of many <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Hanafuda</span> fishing games, where cards are paired to capture them from a central pool.

## <span lang="jv-Latn">Thothit Yogyakarta</span>

A very similar game but played with [Ceki cards](articles/cards/ceki/ceki.md) is known in [Yogyakarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta) as <span lang="jv-Latn" class="noun aka">Thothit</span>[^fn0] (there is also a different game which was called {% gameref thothit %} in Surakarta; see that article for details).

[^fn0]: Older Romanizations spell this <span lang="jv-Latn" class="noun aka">Ṭoṭit</span>.

According to @JavaanseKaartspelen [p. 75], the game is usually played by women.

Three players play with a <span lang="jv-Latn">kepala</span> of 60 <span lang="jv-Latn">ceki</span> cards, so that there are two identical copies of each card.

To decide the starting player, one player draws a card at random, then counts around the circle anti-clockwise starting from themselves (so that a <Cards>1</Cards>, <Cards>4</Cards>, or <Cards>7</Cards> indicates that they are the starting player).

The cards are shuffled and placed face-down in a pile to form the stock.

Beginning with the starting player, each player draws a card from the stock and tries to match any other cards in the pool by rank. All <Cards>1</Cards> and honour cards are considered to be of the same rank. If there is a matching card then they player captures both cards and places them in front of themselves. If there is no matching card then the player places the drawn card face-up as part of the pool.

Once all the cards have been played (and thus all cards captured), the players total up their points. Two _identical_ matching cards are worth 10 points, and each red-stamped card is also worth an additional 10 points. The player with the highest score wins, takes any payment from the others, and then becomes the starting player for the next round.

## <span lang="jv-Latn">Thit-Thit-Dulit</span>

<span lang="jv-Latn" class="noun aka">Thit-Thit-Dulit</span> is an even simpler version of the game for two players, again played in Yogyakarta with a deck of 60 <span lang="jv-Latn">ceki</span> cards.

In this version of the game, a card can only capture if it matches by both suit and rank; it must match its identical partner.
