NB: despite the image of Rashepses tomb by Lepsius {include this from senet
article} looking like they are placing balls, they are apparently placing
lions, according to @SomeRareScenes.

Compare also with the image from {Excavations at Saqqara (1911-1912) the tomb of
hesy James Edward Quibell 1867-1935. Egypt. Maṣlaḥat al-Āthār.}, which shows
lions
