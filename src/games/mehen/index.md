NB: despite the image of Rashepses tomb by Lepsius {include this from senet

Compare also with the image from @TombOfHesy [pl. XI],which shows
lions.

Disappears in the Middle Kingdom, later shows up in the Saite period (26th Dynasty), as a part of a revival of Old Kingdom designs, but the game was probably not played at this point.[@SerpentBoard p. 89] 

A specific tomb is that of Ibi (TT36)—see @TopographicalBibliography_1 [p. 63–5]. See also ‘games’ in the subject index there. Champ. reference is https://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/champollion1844bd1/0562/image,info
