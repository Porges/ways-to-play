Pong is a draw-and-discard card game for four players from Malaysia.

<!-- excerpt -->

In @GamblingGamesOfMalaya [p. 137–8] it is described as being played with
Mahjong tiles, but I think it was probably originally played with
[Ceki](/articles/cards/ceki/) cards. According to the book, it was played in the
state of [Kelantan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelantan).

The game also seems to have been played in Thailand under the name <span class="noun"
lang="th-Latn">Tong</span> (<span lang="th">ตอง</span>), using Thai-style money cards.

## Equipment

If playing with Ceki cards, use two full decks (120 cards total, 4 copies of
each card).

If playing with Mahjong tiles, use 120 tiles: all of the suited (circle, bamboo,
character) tiles, as well as the honour (“dragon”) tiles, but no winds or flowers.

## Setup & Play

Shuffle the tiles or cards. If using tiles, build them into four walls of 30
tiles (15 long × 2 high).

Next, each player draws 11 cards/tiles, then the starting player takes another
card/tile to begin the game.

On a player’s turn they draw a card/tile, then — unless they have won the
game — they discard one. Turns proceed in an anti-clockwise direciton.

The goal of the game is to form a complete hand of 12 tiles, comprising four
sets of three. The sets can either be a **<span lang="ms">tong</span>**
(“barrel”?), meaning 3 identical cards/tiles, or a **<span lang="ms">tong
serong</span>** (“crooked barrel”?) meaning 3 cards/tiles of the same rank but of
various suits. For the purposes of forming <span lang="ms">tong
serong</span>, all the honour cards/tiles are considered to be of the same
rank, so a set could be 3 different dragon tiles, or 3 different honour cards.

Instead of taking from the draw pile, a player can also take the previous
player’s discard. If a player only requires one tile to win, they may take the
winning tile from any player’s discard to complete their hand. (If multiple
players try to claim the same card to win, the next one in seating order takes
it.)

## Scoring

The winning player scores 2 points + 1 point for each pure <span
lang="ms">tong</span> they have in their hand: from only 2 points for a hand
containing four <span lang="ms">tong serong</span>, up to 6 points for a hand
containing four <span lang="ms">tong</span>. Payment may be collected from the
other players on the basis of some fixed amount per point.

The Thai game seems to have different scoring methods and I have not yet been
able to find a good source for them.
