This article collects several simple staking games with shared characteristics:

- bets are placed on a diagrammatic staking layout
- the device providing selection is a single die or teetotum, not several dice
- (at a meta level) I have little other information about the games

<!-- excerpt -->

## Prinola

<p class="lead"><span lang="fil" class="noun">Prinola</span> is a simple gambling game that
used to be played in the Philippines. The name is derived from the Spanish <span
lang="es">pirinola</span>, a spinning-top or teetotum.</p>

The only source I have found for the game is that of Stewart Culin. He also says
the same game is played in China under the name <span lang="yue">車咩</span>
(‘teetotum’, Cantonese: <span lang="yue-Latn">ce1 me1</span>).[@ChineseGames p.
496]{%fn%}Culin transliterates this as <span lang="yue-Latn">ch’é
mé</span>.{%endfn%}

### Equipment

<span lang="fil-Latn" class="noun">Prinola</span> is played using a staking
layout containing symbols for the dice results {%cdice 1%} through {%cdice 6%},
and a six-sided teetotum. The teetotum is usually spun in a shallow dish.

Alternately, the teetotum can also be decorated with animals or other images, in
much the same way as the Chinese versions of {%gameref crown-and-anchor%}.

### Play

Players place their stakes on any of the partitions on the layout. The banker
then spins the teetotum. Any players who selected the square that the teetotum
shows win 4× their stake. All other stakes are lost.

## Belankai/Belanki/Belankas

This is a game that is played in Malaysia,[@GamblingGamesOfMalaya p. 127] and
the name means “king crab”. In @GamblingGamesOfMalaya [p. 127] the name <span
lang="zh">勿人介</span> is also given, although without explanation. In Vietnam,
it is called <span lang="vi" class="noun">Cua Hoàng Đế</span> (‘emperor crab’).

The game is still played currently, and has many online
implementations.{%fn%}See also
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGcRlTl3GdI) for a game streamed
online but with a live table.{%endfn%}

### Equipment

A four-sided teetotum is used, with images of:

- a king crab
- a flower, sun, or star device
- a fish
- a prawn

The staking layout also bears these four symbols.

### Play

The banker spins the teetotum and covers it with another bowl. Players then
place their bets on the outcome in appropriate parts of the layout. Bets can be
placed on a single outcome by placing it within a particular section, or on two
outcomes by placing the stake on a dividing line between two sections.

Any players who have chosen a bet that matches the outcome win. If they placed a
bid on a single outcome they win 3× back, if they placed a bid on two outcomes
they win 1× back.[@TheBelangkasGame] All other stakes are lost.

@GamblingGamesOfMalaya gives the more precise (harsh) returns of 2.7× and 0.9×.
More modern versions might pay 2.85×/2.9× and .95×.[@KingCrab]

Recent versions of the game also include a third bet type, which wins on one
symbol, pushes (neither wins nor loses) on another, and loses on the other two.
This pays 2× or 1.95×.[@KingCrab]

Several online implementations also provide a three-way bet which pays 0.3×.
