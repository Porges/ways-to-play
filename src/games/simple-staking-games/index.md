## Belankai/Belanki/Belankas

This is a game that is played in Malaysia,[@GamblingGamesOfMalaya p. 127] and
the name means “king crab”. In @GamblingGamesOfMalaya [p. 127] the name <span
lang="zh">勿人介</span> is also given, although without explanation. In Vietnam,
it is called <span lang="vi" class="noun">Cua Hoàng Đế</span> (‘emperor crab’).

The game is still played currently, and has many online
implementations.{%fn%}See also

online but with a live table.{%endfn%}

### Equipment

A four-sided teetotum is used, with images of:

- a king crab
- a flower, sun, or star device
- a fish
- a prawn

The staking layout also bears these four symbols.

### Play

The banker spins the teetotum and covers it with another bowl. Players then
place their bets on the outcome in appropriate parts of the layout. Bets can be
placed on a single outcome by placing it within a particular section, or on two
outcomes by placing the stake on a dividing line between two sections.

Any players who have chosen a bet that matches the outcome win. If they placed a
bid on a single outcome they win 3× back, if they placed a bid on two outcomes
they win 1× back.[@TheBelangkasGame] All other stakes are lost.

@GamblingGamesOfMalaya gives the more precise (harsh) returns of 2.7× and 0.9×.
More modern versions might pay 2.85×/2.9× and .95×.[@KingCrab]

Recent versions of the game also include a third bet type, which wins on one
symbol, pushes (neither wins nor loses) on another, and loses on the other two.
This pays 2× or 1.95×.[@KingCrab]

Several online implementations also provide a three-way bet which pays 0.3×.
