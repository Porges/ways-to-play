It is said that the [Ngāti
Haua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C4%81ti_Hau%C4%81) chief [Wiremu Tamihana
Te Waharoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiremu_Tamihana) once offered to play
<span lang="mi" class="noun">Mū Tōrere</span> with [Governor
Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grey), with the whole country as a
stake — Grey apparently declined.[@TaongaTukuIho p. 54]
