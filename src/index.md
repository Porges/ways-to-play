Welcome to <cite>Ways to Play</cite>.
This is a site about games, traditional and modern, that are played around the world. There are two main areas on this site, of [<span role="img" aria-label="">ðŸ§¾</span>&#8239;Articles](/articles/) about games or families of games, and [<span role="img" aria-label="">ðŸŽ²</span>&#8239;Games](/games/) for rules of the games themselves. There is also an index of [game names by language](/game-names-index/), if you are trying to locate a game.

That said, every page on this website should be considered a work in progress: nothing is definite, and everything is subject to revision!

You might also be interested in the [<span role="img" aria-label="">ðŸ“£</span>&#8239;About](/about/) page or perhaps the site-wide [<span role="img" aria-label="">ðŸ“š</span>&#8239;Bibliography](/bibliography/).
