# Japanese Hanafuda Brands
## Identification 

The branding system of traditional <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>
manufacturers can be confusing. Generally the top of the container (whether a
box or wrapper) will have a brand, which indicates the quality of the cards, and
the <em>type</em> of cards is written on the front end of the container. For
example, a box of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> cards with Napoleon on
the front indicates their highest-quality card, but it could contain either
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> or <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kabufuda</span>
cards.

Traditionally, decks were boxed in sets of two, usually one with black backs and
the other with red backs. The outer box containing the two decks would have a
wider image on the front, and then each deck inside the box would be wrapped
individually. An example wrapper is shown folded flat below. The front end of
the box (at bottom right) is as discussed above. The sides of the box show the
manufacturer’s other brands, and sometimes awards that they have won, and the
back end of the box (at top left) usually has text about the manufacturer or a
list of brands.

### Manufacturer’s Marks

Within the deck, the manufacturer’s name or mark is nowadays always on one of
the Paulownia junk cards, but on older decks it can be on a Peony or Wisteria
(for an example, see [below](#oishi-tengudo)), or another card entirely.

>
> Manufacturer’s marks from <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span>, Angel, and <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Maruē</span>.


Often the mark is a simplified version of the name,[^direction] or a different <span lang="ja-Latn">kanji</span>, usually combined with a geometric shape. When pronouncing the mark the shape is usually also ‘read’, so that <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span>’s mark—a stylized <span lang="ja">福</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">fuku</span> ‘good fortune’) inside a circle—is read <span lang="ja-Latn">maru-fuku</span> ‘circle-fuku’, much like the brand “[Circle K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_K)”. The same can also be done with the square  (<span lang="ja">角</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">kaku</span>), a corner at top-right (┐) can be described as a carpenter’s square  (<span lang="ja">矩 </span> <span lang="ja-Latn">kane</span>), and a corner pointing upwards (∧) is called a mountain (<span lang="ja">山</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">yama</span>).

[^direction]: Also be aware that Japanese can be written in either direction; @OstasiatischeSpielkarten [p. 136] describes a deck made by a mysterious manufacturer named ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Dōtennin</span>’!

### Dating Decks

Dating old decks can be difficult. As manufacturers have not published any
information about when certain brands or decks were produced, we can only go via
public information. Some suggested methods are:

> [!figure]
>
> ![A blank hanafuda card with the number 120124 printed on it.](date_card.jpg)
>
> ```yaml
> position: "aside"
> size: "small"
> ```
>
> A <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> blank card indicating the date of manufacture (2012–01–24).


* With recent <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> decks, the blank card
  included has a 6-digit date of manufacture printed on it. This is the only
  case I know where the date is explicitly marked.
* Otherwise, the most accurate method of dating is to use tax stamps (see
  below), if the deck has any still present. This only works for decks produced
  up to 1989, when the tax on playing-cards was removed.
* For more recent decks, barcodes can give some clues: Japanese barcodes
  beginning with <span class="barcode">49⋯</span> have been used since 1978, but
  barcodes beginning with <span class="barcode">45⋯</span> were introduced in
  1992.
* Japanese written in a right-to-left ordering generally indicates that the deck
  would have been made before the end of <abbr title="World War Two">WWII</abbr>
  (from here on, I use the term ‘pre-war’). Thus, <span lang="ja">任天堂</span>
  is written <bdo dir="rtl" lang="ja">任天堂</bdo> on very old decks.
  <em>However</em>, some manufacturers such as <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi
  Tengudō</span> or <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nihon Karuta</span> have persisted in
  using right-to-left ordering even into the present era.

### Tax Stamps

For most of the 20th century, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> cards were
taxed by the Japanese government. This tax has changed over time and thus can be
used to identify the time period during which a deck was sold.

The following table is summarized from [a series of
articles](https://japanplayingcardmuseum.com/category/0-0-cartatax-law-history/)
provided by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ebashi</span> on his website:

## Current Manufacturers

All current Japanese manufacturers that I know of are based in <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span> prefecture. The <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kansai</span>
region (which contains both <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span> and <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Ōsaka</span>) is the original source of <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> cards.

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> is the most prominent company that produces
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> cards today. The company was founded in
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span> in 1889 by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yamauchi
Fusajirō</span> (<span lang="ja">山内房治郎</span>), and it was run by the <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Yamauchi</span> family for three generations until <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Yamauchi Hiroshi</span> (<span lang="ja">山内溥</span>) stepped
down in 2002.

> [!todo]: this seems dubious.
>
> In the early days of the company,  <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Fusajirō</span> joined forces with the “tobacco king” <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai Kichibei</span> (<span lang="ja">村井吉兵衛</span>) who had founded the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai</span> Brothers tobacco company in 1892. Like <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span>, who were one of the first companies to produce Western-style cards in Japan, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai</span> Bros. was a company that was incorporating Western elements: they were operating in conjunction with American tobacco companies, and many of their cigarette brands bore English titles. Together the two companies invested to purchase printing equipment from an American company in New York that had been taken over by the <abbr title="United States Playing Card Company">USPCC</abbr>, and formed a venture called “Tōyō Printing”[^fn0] (<span lang="ja">東洋印刷</span>).[@EbashiCigaretteCards]

These tobacco cards often featured a design which combined Western playing cards with the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> pattern. In 1904, the Japanese government nationalized the manufacture of all tobacco products,[^fn1] and <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tōyō</span> Printing was sold along with the rest of the company.[@TarHeel p. 362]

A too-brief summary of their later success: after WWII, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> managed to survive a period of crushing taxation on playing-card products, which wiped out many of the smaller manufacturers. In the second half of the 20th century they (famously!) diversified into children’s toys and, later on, video games.

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span>’s manufacturers mark is a circled <span
lang="ja" class="circled">福</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">fuku</span>,
‘fortune’). This was originally the trade-name (<span lang="ja">屋号</span>

the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yamauchi</span> family.

One interesting deck they used to produce was **Hana-Trump**, which combined
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> cards with the cards of the international
standard playing card deck. Each rank of the standard pack corresponds to a
month of the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> deck:

Because there are four more cards in the standard deck compared to the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> one, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> added an additional four cards (and two jokers) to the set. These extra cards are counterparts for specialized pieces of equipment present in boxed [Hachi-Hachi](games/hachi-hachi/hachi-hachi.md) (<span lang="ja">八八</span>) sets.

From left-to-right, after the joker, these are: a blindfolded samurai, with text reading <span lang="ja"><q>不見出</q></span> (88 sets have a piece labelled <span lang="ja"><q>不見転</q></span>, ‘loose morals’); a <span lang="ja-Latn">gunbai</span> (<span lang="ja">軍配</span>), a military leader’s fan which is nowadays used by sumo referees, which is inscribed <span lang="ja"><q>跡絶之章</q></span> (88 sets have a piece labelled <span lang="ja"><q>両桐絶体之章</q></span>); a rice winnowing basket (<span lang="ja">箕</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">mi</span>) inscribed <span lang="ja"><q>手役之章</q></span> (hand-<span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> prize); and an award medal reading <span lang="ja"><q>吟見勲賞</q></span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">Ginmi Kunshō</span>, ‘<span lang="ja-Latn">Ginmi</span> Medal’), which is a prize for the ‘top player’ (<span lang="ja-Latn">Ginmi</span>, usually spelt <span lang="ja">吟味</span>, 88 sets have a piece labelled <span lang="ja">銀見勲章</span>).

Angel was originally named <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Okina Karuta Honpo</span> (<span lang="ja">翁かるた本舗</span>), and was first based in the city of [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yōkaichi</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkaichi,_Shiga) (now <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Higashiōmi</span>), <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Shiga</span> prefecture (<span lang="ja">滋賀県八日市市</span>). It is now based in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span>. They still use the character <span lang="ja">翁 </span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">okina</span>) as their maker’s mark, or otherwise the name Angel is written <span lang="ja">エンゼル</span>. On some cards this is [spelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ateji) <span lang="ja">縁是留</span>.

Angel currently produces <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> and <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kabufuda</span> in two brands:

* <span lang="ja">千鳥</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">chidori</span> ‘numerous birds’)
* <span lang="ja">元禄</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">Genroku</span>, an era which spanned 1688–1704)

Other brands produced in the past included:[@ModernJapaneseWrappers p. 45]

A small manufacturer, founded in 1921.

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsui Tengudō</span> was founded in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span>[^osaka] in 1897 by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsui Shigejiro</span> (<span lang="ja">松井重次郎</span>), and was run by the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsui</span> family for three generations until it closed in 2010 after <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsui Shigeo</span> (<span lang="ja">松井重夫 </span>, 1931–2016) retired.[@IwanoMatsui]

[^osaka]: There was also an <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōsaka</span>-based <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsui Tengudō</span>, started by the younger brother of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsui Shigejiro</span>, which had actually opened before the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span> branch. It used the same manufacturer’s mark and existed in 1914[@JapaneseBusinessmen1914 p. 219] but closed after the second generation.

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsui Tengudō</span> was the last manufacturer to make cards entirely by hand;[@SalterJapanese] <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsui Shigeo</span> had recovered this process in 1976 as a way to distinguish his cards from those being produced by other manufacturers, after a former teacher of his told him to “make something that doesn’t exist anywhere”.[@TewazaNoKioku]

Since closing, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsui Tengudō</span> decks now fetch high prices on Yahoo! Auctions, often selling for several hundred US dollars.

### <img src='/small-images/marue.svg' alt="" class="inline-img" /> <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Maruē</span> (<span lang="ja">マルエー</span>)

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Maruē</span> was from the city of [<span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Mino</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mino,_Gifu), in <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Gifu</span> prefecture (<span lang="ja">岐阜県美濃市</span>).
Their manufacturer’s mark was a circled <span lang="ja">英</span> (<span
lang="ja-Latn">ē</span>), i.e. <span lang="ja-Latn">maru-ē</span>. However,
<span lang="ja">英</span> has the meaning of ‘flower’ and can also be read with
the same pronunciation as <span lang="ja">花</span> <span
lang="ja-Latn">hana</span>, making this mark very punny.

> Earliest <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nihon Karuta</span> trademarks, registered in 1915.[@Trademarks1924_8 p. 295]

The mark of both of these companies was <span lang="ja">中</span> with corner at
top-right.

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nihon Karuta</span> claimed to have been founded in
1806.[@TewazaNoKioku] It is hard to prove this, but an earlier company named
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tamada Fukushōdō</span> that used the same manufacturer’s
mark had definitely existed in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span> since before
1895 (see image). It is unclear precisely what the relationship was between the
two companies, but <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nihon Karuta</span> advertised their
decks as being in the “<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tamada</span> style” (<span
lang="ja">玉田式</span>), and certainly the patterns they printed were very
similar. <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nihon Karuta</span> decks also often have the
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tamada</span> name printed on their branding cards. A safe
guess would be that <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nihon Karuta</span> was a rebranding or
expansion of the original <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tamada Fukushōdō</span> name,
either to reflect the scope of a larger company or to project its ambitions.

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nihon Karuta</span> itself seems to have been founded in
1915, as this is when its earliest trademark registrations
appear.[@Trademarks1924_8 p. 295] Other records show that it existed in
1916[@JapaneseBusinessmen1916 p. 135], 1948[@Yamaguchi p. 102] and through to at
least the early 1980s.[@ModernJapaneseWrappers p. 54]

in 1946. They still exist but no longer appear to produce <span class="noun"

They also produced a poker-sized <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> deck that
included point values on the cards, as well as the name of the month and the
flower associated with the month. Interestingly, the point values on some of the
cards indicate that they were intended to be played with Hawaiian rules.

The Universal Playing Card Company was founded in 1914, and based in <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Ōsaka</span>.[@UniversalInfo] Their maker’s mark on <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> decks was a drawstring purse (<span lang="ja">巾
着</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">kinchaku</span>); elsewhere they used a
six-pointed star containing “<small>UNIVERSAL</small>” or an interlocked U &amp;
C. Their own brands included:[@ModernJapaneseWrappers pp. 59–62]

* <span lang="ja">ゴム花</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">gomuhana</span>, ‘rubber flower’)
* <span lang="ja">萬年花</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">mannenhana</span>, ‘10&thinsp;000 year flower’)

In addition to <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>, they produced Western cards
and Ceki cards for export. In 1935 they exported a total of 10 million
decks.[@UniversalInfo]

Like other manufacturers, they produced combination <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Trump-Hana</span> (<span lang="ja">トランプ花</span>) decks, and
in multiple sizes: the smallest size deck (numbered “<strong>350</strong>”) has
cards that are much closer in size to that of <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> than other brands’ combination cards are. A very
similar deck was published under the brand “Star Playing Cards” (numbered
“<strong>807</strong>”, with a five-pointed star).

I’m not sure of the significance of the “vase” Joker, since usually the Joker has the manufacturer’s name. It could be intended as a multilingual pun on “Universal” (<span lang="ja">ユニバーセル </span> <span lang="ja-Latn">yunibāseru</span>) → “Universe” (<span lang="ja">ユ ニバース</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">yunibāsu</span>), which sounds like “uni-vase” (one vase).

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nishi&shy;gushi</span> also manufactured board games (such as [Gunjin Shogi](games/gunjin-shogi/gunjin-shogi.md)) Some of their decks were manufactured by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nihon Karuta</span>. Their mark was a circled <span class="circled" lang="ja">榮</span>, the same as <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōwadō</span>. Brands included:

### <img src='/small-images/maruei.svg' alt="" class="inline-img" /> <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōwadō</span> (<span lang="ja">京和堂</span>)

A company about which I know very little. Presumably from the name they were
based in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span>. Their mark was a circled <span
class="circled" lang="ja">榮</span>, the same as <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Nishi&shy;guchi Shōten</span>. Their brands included:

* <span lang="ja">京寶船</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">kyō&shy;takarabune</span>, ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span> treasure ship’)
* <span lang="ja">京紅梅</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">kyō&shy;kōbai</span>, ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span> red plum’)[^fn3]

[^fn3]: This is a <em>likely</em> categorization based upon the design of the box, but the maker’s mark appears to be different.

In 1914, the company was run by one <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kataoka Ei</span> (<span lang="ja">片岡エイ</span>). (Probably the logo dates from after <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kamigataya</span> was taken over by the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kataoka</span> family.)
