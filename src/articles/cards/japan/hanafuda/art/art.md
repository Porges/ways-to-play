<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> cards first appeared in Japan in the middle of the <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn"  noun="true" pronouncer="Nipponese" file="pronunciation_ja_江戸.mp3">Edo</Pronounce> period (<span lang="ja">江戸</span>, 1603–1868), but the distant origins of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> cards lie in much older “object-comparing games” (<span lang="ja">物合わせ</span> <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn"  file="pronunciation_ja_物合わせ.mp3" pronouncer="poyotan">mono-awase</Pronounce>) that had been played since the <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn"  noun="true" pronouncer="skent" file="pronunciation_ja_平安.mp3">Heian</Pronounce> period (<span lang="ja">平安</span>, 794–1185).

## Origins

In their original form, <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span> were courtly competitions in which various objects were compared as to their qualities or unique attributes:[^awase-term] objects that were judged in these competitions included artefacts such as fans or paintings;[@BrocadeByNight p. 242] flowers and plants (chrysanthemums, iris roots,[@WorldOfTheShiningPrince p. 163] wild pinks); animals (insects, song&shy;birds[@WorldOfTheShiningPrince p. 163]); incense; tea[@AnIntroductionToJapaneseTeaRitual p. 26]; or — what we are most interested in here — shells.

[^awase-term]: The same terminology of <span lang="ja-Latn">awase</span> was also used for sports such as cock-fighting.[@WorldOfTheShiningPrince p. 165]

The competitions were generally organized between two teams, named Left (who
started the game, and usually had higher-ranking members)[^lhs] and Right, and
consisted of a series of rounds in which each team would present one item at a
time, often with accompanying poem. Another format involved the presentation of
a selection of objects on a miniature artificial garden or island called a <span
lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> (<span lang="ja">洲浜</span>), which was
constructed especially for the competition and which could be made out of
expensive wood or precious metals. The teams were outfitted in different
colours — the Left in warm colours, orange or purple, the Right in cool,
yellow or blue — and their accompaniments could also be chosen to match the
team colours.[@GoldenShells p. 90]

[^lhs]: In Japan, the left-hand side was traditionally considered the dominant or “masculine” side (see the [naming of shells below](#kai-awase-to-kai-oi)), the opposite of European tradition. In the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Heian</span> period, the Minister of the Left (<span lang="ja">左大臣</span>) outranked the Minister of the Right (<span lang="ja">右大臣</span>).

> A depiction of the full-moon competition including two <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>, from an edition of unknown date.

In 966, Emperor Murakami held a <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span>
competition on the 15th of the 8th month (the most important full moon of the
year). The construction of each team’s <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> is
recorded in the [<cite lang="ja-Latn">Eiga Monogatari</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiga_Monogatari):

> Both sides worked furiously, determined not to be outdone. The contestants
> from the Office of Painting submitted a painted landscape tray depicting
> flowering plants of heavenly beauty, a garden stream, and massive rocks.
> Various kinds of insects were lodged in a rustic fence made of silver foil.
> The artists had also painted a view of the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōi</span>
> River, showing figures strolling nearby and cormorant boats with basket fires.
> Near the insects there was a poem.
>
> The Office of Palace Works presented an interesting tray, carved with great
> ingenuity to resemble a high tide, which they had planted with artifical
> flowers and carved bamboo and pines. Their poem was attached to a spray of
> fresh <span
> lang="ja-Latn">[ominaeshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrinia)</span>.[@JapaneseAristocraticLife
> p. 92]

These elaborate competitions could run all day; another famous competition held
by Emperor Murakami six years earlier (on the 30th day of the 3rd month of 960),
ran from 4 p.m. until dawn, when the drunken winning team exited while singing
and dancing. A courtier’s diary recorded the elaborate preparations made at the
palace:[@MuseInCompetition pp. 214–217]

> […] Special care was taken on this occasion as many eminent people of refined
> taste would be attending the event, and so new plants and flowers were
> carefully chosen and added to the garden. The Chamberlain Minor Captain <span class="noun"
> lang="ja-Latn">Sukenobu</span> was in charge of the garden, and he had oak
> logs arranged like a fence and entwined with ivy so that it looked like a
> cedar forest. He also placed stepping stones here and there so that one could
> walk along on them. The garden gave the impression of a pastoral landscape and
> looked more delightful than usual.
>
> The blinds were replaced by new ones. The Emperor’s seat was arranged in the
> anteroom at the southern end of the gallery. The atmosphere was so pleasant
> that it defied description. […]
>
> […] The poems [of the Left] were engraved on the silver leaves of
> golden-yellow mountain roses placed in the <span
> lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>—truly a beautiful work of art of exquisite
> workmanship. The tables were made of rosewood and other wood. The design of
> the <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> was quite interesting and charming. The
> cover was of varied shades of dark red and wisteria were embroidered on it;
> the mat was of violet brocade. Then two court girls […] brought in another
> <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span> for scoring, the design of which was
> wisteria tendrils made of gold and silver. A twig was to be removed each time
> a point was scored.

As mentioned in the last paragraph, a special <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>
could be used for scoring. During a contest in 1035 one side planted miniature
pine trees to track their score; at another in 1078, “the Left inserted arrows
with silver shafts and glass feathers into a target to mark their wins, and the
Right placed tiny replicas of musical instruments in a silver box inlaid with
crystal.”[@BrocadeByNight p. 243][^scoring-tracks]

[^scoring-tracks]: Elaborate scoring tracks were [also used for incense competitions](https://images.dnpartcom.jp/ia/workDetail?id=TAM000634).

### An aside about <span lang="ja-Latn">Uta-awase</span>

Out of all the types of competition, the most esteemed was to eventually be the
poetry match (<span lang="ja">歌合わせ</span> <span
lang="ja-Latn">uta-awase</span>). At first it was a competition like the others,
where the poem was treated as an <em>object</em> to be chosen and presented by
the competitor, the poet might not even be present, and more attention was paid
to the accompanying costumes and music than the quality of the
poetry.[@BrocadeByNight p. 242] 

The poetry competition was highly ritualized, where the result of a contest was
not only about who could compose the better poem; on average, authors of a
higher rank were more likely to win. In some cases, the winner of a round was
decided by convention, and furthermore, some poems could not lose. The first
poem presented by the Left team, a poem complimenting the host, or a poem by the
Emperor himself would <em>at worst</em> result in a draw.[@UtaawaseJudgments p.
102] At one competition [Emperor <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Uda</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Uda) (<span
lang="ja">宇多天皇</span>) awarded his own poem a draw, stating “how can an
imperial poem lose?”[@BrocadeByNight p. 244]

Later, during what <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ito Setsuko</span> terms the “silver age” of <span lang="ja-Latn">uta-awase</span>,[@MuseInCompetition p. 207] the work of the poet became more important, and poetry competitions were held without the extravagant <span lang="ja-Latn">suhama</span>. The competitions became more austere and aware of the world outside the courtly realm; in 1083 a planned grand competition was cancelled as it was thought to be inappropriate given the unrest at the time.[^genpei] Smaller and more intimate competitions were held with poetry as their focus. This doesn’t mean that the proceedings were any less elaborate; the largest competition of this type involved nine poets competing over 1500 rounds.

### <span lang="ja-Latn">Kai-awase</span> to <span lang="ja-Latn">Kai-ōi</span>

The earliest recorded <Pronounce lang="ja-Latn" pronouncer="skent" file="pronunciation_ja_貝合わせ.mp3" >kai-awase</Pronounce> (<span lang="ja">貝合せ</span>, ‘shell competition’) contest dates from 1040, and was held at [the Ise shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Grand_Shrine) by [Emperor Go-Suzaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Suzaku)’s first daughter, Princess <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nagako</span>. This was a competition very much in the spirit of the other <span lang="ja-Latn">mono-awase</span> games, and consisted of twenty rounds, each shell being presented with an accompanying poem.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 269]

<span lang="ja-Latn">Kai-awase</span> developed from this early
comparing-competition form into a completely different style of game called
<span lang="ja-Latn">kai-ōi</span> (<span lang="ja">貝覆い</span>, ‘shell
covering’) that was based upon collecting matching pairs of shells. <span
lang="ja-Latn">Kai-awase</span> itself died out and there is no record of any
competitions taking place after the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Heian</span>
period.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 270] However, by the <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Edo</span> period, the two terms would be conflated, with <span
lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span> being used for the matching game as
well,[@KaiOi][@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 270] and today <span
lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span> is the term most commonly used for replica game
sets.

> Four generations of women playing <span lang="ja-Latn" >kai-ōi</span>.<br />From <cite lang="ja">女有職莩文庫</cite> (1866), by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Okada Tamayama</span> (<span lang="ja">岡田玉山</span>).

Unlike <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span>, the new game was exclusively played with clam (<span lang="ja">蛤</span>) shells, and it offered definitive terms for deciding the winner. In one method of play, the left-hand sides of the shells — also termed the “male” (<span lang="ja">陽</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">yō</span> = yang) or ‘ground’ (<span lang="ja">地</span>) shells — were arranged face-down on the ground. The right-hand sides — the “female” (<span lang="ja">陰</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">in</span> = yin) or ‘coming out’ (<span lang="ja">出</span>) shells — were then drawn from their <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-oke</span> (<span lang="ja">貝桶</span>, ‘shell bucket’) one-by-one and the players would attempt to match them with those on the floor.[@GoldenShells p. 92] Whoever was the first to point out a (successful) match would capture both halves of the shell, and the winner was the player who collected the most shells.

Early instructional books for women from the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Muromachi</span> period (1392–1573) include rules that state that the game is played with twelve shells,[^video] which should be arranged in a circle on the ground, and that the drawn shell should be placed in the centre, with the pointed end (“head”) directed towards the highest-ranking person in the room.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 270] Evidently the game could get physical, as those same books warn that “to quarrel and remove shells by force is something that only men and courtesans do.”

[^video]: A video showing how this game would have been played can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4_bz-okxM).

The monk <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">[Kenkō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshida_Kenk%C5%8D)</span> (<span lang="ja">兼好</span>, <abbr title="died">d.</abbr> <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 1352) also offered guidance in his book <cite>Essays in Idleness</cite>, published around 1330:[@EssaysInIdleness p. 130]

> [!aside]
>
> <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kenkō</span> goes on to apply this strategic advice as part of an extended metaphor for good governance and living well:
>
> > In all things, do not seek for distant advantage. Simply maintain correctly what is close to hand. In the words of the Chinese sage [Duke Xiao of Qing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Pu), ‘Do what is good, and ask no questions of the future.’ Surely a ruler should also govern in this way.

> If someone engaged in a game of shell matching neglects the shells in front of
> him while he looks around to check what others might be hiding in their
> sleeves or by their knees, his own shells will be snatched from in front of
> him. Those who are good at the game seem not to go to the length of taking
> shells from distant players but limit themselves to those close at hand, yet
> they manage to acquire a large number.

While later depictions (such as the images above) usually represent the game as only played by women, diary entries and paintings from the time show that the game was originally played by everyone, often in mixed teams. Losing teams would also request re-matches to try to beat the victorious team.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 257]

Records of the imperial household indicate that the shell-matching game was played formally nearly five hundred times over the period 1481–1589, sometimes as many as nine times a month.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 257]

> This early depiction from the 16th-century scroll <cite>Tale of Brief Slumbers</cite> <cite lang="ja">うたたね草紙</cite> shows a mixed group playing <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-ōi</span> (at left).

When played with many shells, the game must have been difficult, since the clues that point to a match are solely the subtle shades and contours of the shell, and the only way to test if shells truly match is to pick them up and attempt to join them together. In fact, white shells with few markings were specifically selected to make the game as difficult as possible.[@GoldenOpportunity p. 11] Considering that traditional sets could contain up to 360 shells,[^modern] this was a game for a class of person who had a lot of leisure time on their hands.

[^modern]: Modern replicas usually only have around 54, but an elaborate set produced between 2013–2015 by forty-six artisans in [<span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Wajima</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wajima,_Ishikawa) contains 720 shells featuring Australian wild flowers.[@GoldenOpportunity p. 4]

Later the game set itself turned into a luxury item: the interior of the shells was at first decorated with matching fabrics, and then elaborately painted or even gilded. These matching images were used to confirm a correct match after both shells were selected. After the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kamakura</span> period (1333), it became common to illustrate the shells with matching scenes from the [Tale of Genji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Genji) (<span lang="ja">源氏物語</span> <Pronounce file="pronunciation_ja_源氏物語.mp3" pronouncer="straycat88" lang="ja-Latn">Genji Monogatari</Pronounce>) — the game is also played in Chapter 45 of the novel itself. Other designs included shells with half of a poem in each, so that the matching pair could be read as a complete poem; these types of the game would eventually evolve into the <span lang="ja-Latn">uta-garuta</span> (<span lang="ja">歌骨牌</span>) poetry cards.

During the 17th century, a personal <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-ōi</span> set became a standard component of a noble bride’s wedding gifts, as the joining of the matching shells was symbolic of the join&shy;ing of husband and wife in marriage. However, the elaborate sets with their hand-painted and gilded interiors must have been ex&shy;pen&shy;sive to create and only owned by the richest of families. Indeed, at times restrictions were put in place so that <em>only</em> noble families of the upper ranks were permitted to include the game in their bridal trousseaux.[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 265] When the time came to hand over the wedding gifts, it was customary for the <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-oke</span> to be the first item presented,[@JapaneseGamesOfMemory p. 265] and they were eventually to become the most important of all the gifts given to the bride.[@GoldenOpportunity p. 11] This custom eventually died out as samurai culture was ended during the late 19th century.[@GoldenOpportunity p. 11]

### <span lang="ja-Latn">Hana-awase</span>

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> seem to originate in a combination of the themes of <span lang="ja-Latn">kai-awase</span> — matching sets, poetry, conventionalized art — with the ideas introduced by the Portuguese playing cards — a regular structure of *suits* divided into different *ranks*.

The two distinct schools of playing-card games first combined in the form of <span lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</span> (<span lang="ja">花合せ</span>) decks. These early 18th century ancestors of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> (such as the deck pictured below) show a very regular configuration of cards for each flower, which evolved during the 18th and 19th centuries into the unusual configuration of the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> deck.

> Some of the cards from a <span lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</span> deck produced circa 1704 (at least before 1710). This type of deck originally contained 400 cards but many are missing, and the extant set pictured here comprises cards from several different packs. Note the chrysanthemum with <span lang="ja-Latn">sake</span> cup in the third card on the top row.

While decks such as the above are obviously for a different style of game, most of the imagery that would become part of the <span
lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> deck was already present.

At the moment it is unclear exactly how the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> deck was developed from the <span lang="ja-Latn">hana-awase</span> cards.[^fn0] It seems that at some point an enterprising manufacturer began to produce a stripped-down version that Japanese <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> scholar <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ebashi Takashi</span> (<span lang="ja">江橋崇</span>) calls the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Musashino</span> (<span lang="ja">武蔵野</span>) deck.

[^fn0]: I hope to expand on this in future!

### Banning & Legalization

Sometime after their introduction, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> games were restricted as part of a total ban on gambling introduced during the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kansei</span> Reforms[^prohibition] (1787–1793). This ban was to remain in place for nearly 200 years until, in 1886, a bookstore owner in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōsaka</span> named <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Maeda Kihei</span> (<span lang="ja">前田喜兵衛</span>) decided to open a store selling <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>.

[^prohibition]: During the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kansei</span> Reforms, gambling was prohibited by the <span lang="ja">博奕賭ノ勝負禁止ノ儀ニ付触書</span>, promulgated by Matsudaira Sadanobu on the 12th of January, 1788.[@SatireWithinKibyōshi p. 44]

Things had already begun to change in 1885, after a ban on Western playing cards (<span lang="ja">西洋かるた</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">seiyō karuta</span>) was lifted due to complaints from foreign officials.[@EbashiHanafuda pp. 189–192] <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Maeda Kihei</span>[^rogue] became convinced through his reading of legal texts that the selling of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> was not actually prohibited, and he moved to <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tōkyō</span> in December 1885 with a plan to open a <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hana&shy;fuda</span> shop. However, he found that the local landlords refused to let to him, believing his business illegal, and he was unable to convince news&shy;papers to print his advertisements. In order to prove himself correct, he came up with a cunning plan: he officially petitioned the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tōkyō</span> police to ban the sale of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hana&shy;fuda</span>. His petition was declined, the police stating that the sale of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hana&shy;fuda</span> was legal, and later that month he opened his first shop in the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yagenbori</span> neighbourhood of [Chūō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D,_Tokyo) district in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tōkyō</span> (<span lang="ja">中央区薬研堀町</span>, now part of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Higashi–Nihonbashi</span>).  The shop was named “<Pronounce lang="ja-Latn" noun="true" pronouncer="poyotan" file="pronunciation_ja_上方屋.mp3" >Kamigataya</Pronounce>” (<span lang="ja">上方屋</span>, ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span> region store’).[@EbashiHanafuda pp. 189–192][@OpeningKamigataya]

[^rogue]: <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kihei</span> appears to have been something of a rogue: he is somewhat infamous in the philately community for selling collections of counterfeit stamps to unsuspecting tourists.

> Ever the promotor, at the end of 1887, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Maeda</span> published this <span lang="ja-Latn">sugoroku</span> game based on the story of his struggle to open a store selling playing cards. The track spirals in a counter-clockwise direction to the centre of the board, where the final square (marked <span lang="ja">上り</span>) shows Japanese and Western cards and dice celebrating together.

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kamigataya</span> was thus the first store to openly sell <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>. A month later, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Maeda</span> opened a second branch of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kamigataya</span> in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Muromachi</span> district (<span lang="ja">室町</span>), and this was quickly followed by a third store in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ginza</span> (<span lang="ja">銀座</span>) in March. To promote the opening of the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ginza</span> store, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Maeda</span> also staged a <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>-themed play in March 1886, which was held at the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Chitose</span> theatre (now called the [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Meiji-za</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji-za)).

Once the viability of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> had been pro&shy;ven, other manufacturers appeared quickly: the com&shy;pany that was later to become <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nin&shy;tendo</span> began producing <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> cards in 1889. Other companies such as <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi Tengudō</span> claim to have been operating discreetly during the pro&shy;hi&shy;bition period; in their case behind the doors of a rice merchant named <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Minatoya</span> (<span lang="ja">湊屋</span>).[@OishiTengudoHistory4]

### Changing Attitudes

Even after prohibition had ended, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> retained
a poor reputation, and gambling with the cards remained illegal. In 1892, <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Korekata Kojima</span> (<span lang="ja">児島惟謙</span>,
1837–1908), who was the head of Japan’s supreme court (<span lang="ja">大審院</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">daishinin</span>), was accused along with five
other supreme court judges of gambling with <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>
(<span lang="ja">弄花</span>, <span lang="ja-Latn">rōka</span>). Due to a lack
of evidence, the case was dropped, but <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kojima</span>
accepted ‘moral responsibility’ for the scandal and resigned his
position.[@EmperorOfJapan p. 813]

Despite this “image problem”, playing <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> became part of what it meant to be a <span lang="ja-Latn">shinshi</span> (<span lang="ja">紳士</span>) — that is, a modern, worldly gentleman.[^fn1] The author <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Uchida Roan</span> (1868–1929) is said to have joked:

[^fn1]: The Japanese word <span lang="ja-Latn">shinshi</span> had originally been coined to translate the English “gentleman”,[@TheEastandtheIdeaofEurope p. 32–8] and was particularly associated with those who enthusiastically embraced Westernization during the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</span> period.

<blockquote lang="ja">紳士の資格は？　弄花と蓄妾と負債と奔走。</blockquote>

> What are the qualifications of a <span lang="ja-Latn">shinshi</span>? Gambling
> with <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>, keeping a mistress, being in debt,
> and running about.

Another commentator remarked ironically that “if you can’t play skillfully with
48 flower cards, you can’t be a <span lang="ja-Latn">sōninkan</span> [<span
lang="ja">奏任官</span>, a type of official appointed by the prime minister]”.

The author and politician [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Suematsu
Kenchō</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suematsu_Kench%C5%8D) (<span
lang="ja">末松 謙澄</span>) described the attitude at the time in his 1905
English-language book @FantasyOfFarJapan [p. 176]:

> In times gone by no game of cards having any resemblance to gambling was
> played among the gentry; moral discipline forbade such. Since the introduction
> of European ideas, the rigidity of discipline has somewhat slackened and cards
> are now played to some extent. Nevertheless, people do not consider
> card-playing good taste. If they play they do so with some diffidence,
> somewhat in a similar way as smoking is done by ladies in European society
> nowadays.

However, despite his protestation in the book that “I do not care for playing at
cards, but I know the methods”, he goes on to give a detailed account of the
gameplay — far more than a casual observer would know!

> <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai</span>’s main competitor was <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Iwaya</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">岩谷商会</span>), run by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Iwaya Matsuhei</span> (<span lang="ja">岩谷松平</span>), who had a more nationalistic outlook. Interestingly, the iconography of their cigarette brands overlaps significantly with that of later <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> brands — some examples include <span lang="ja-Latn">dai&shy;tengu</span> (<span lang="ja">大天狗</span> “large tengu”), <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Fuji</span> (<span lang="ja">冨士</span>), and <span lang="ja-Latn">hinode</span> (<span lang="ja">日乃出</span> “sunrise”) — and their chief logo was that of a red <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tengu</span>, which is also strongly associated with <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>. It is unclear to me whether there is any real link here or if the coincidence simply reflects the conventionality of traditional Japanese art.

Another popularizing force during this period was that of cigarette manufacturers who began to include <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>-patterned cards in cigarette packages as collectible items. The manufacturer <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai</span> Brothers (<span lang="ja">村井兄弟商會</span>, founded by the “tobacco king” <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai Kichibei</span> (<span lang="ja">村井吉兵衛</span>) in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kyōto</span> in 1892) included tobacco cards which combined <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> with Western playing cards. <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai</span> was a progressive company that enthusiastically embraced Westernization across the whole of its business. They operated in conjunction with Western tobacco companies such as the British-American Tobacco Company, and many of their cigarette brands bore English titles. Where his competitor <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Iwaya</span> would name a brand <span lang="ja"> 日乃出</span> (<span lang="ja-Latn">hinode</span> “sunrise”), <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai</span> used the English name “Sunshine”.

In 1899, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Murai</span> formed the subsidiary “Tōyō Printing”[^fn2] (<span lang="ja">東洋印刷</span>), and acquired printing equipment and training from the United States. With this equipment, they were able to produce high-quality packaging, and there is some suggestion that they worked with <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> to produce the first Western-style playing cards produced in Japan (1902).[@EbashiCigaretteCards] Certainly, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span>’s early cards are often imitations of those produced by such US companies as the National Card Company which had been merged with the United States Playing-card Company in 1894.[@WOPCNCC]

[^fn2]: In some sources this is given in its translated form as the “Oriental Printing Company”.

In 1904, the Japanese government nationalized[^nationalized] the manufacture of all tobacco products, and the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tōyō</span> Printing subsidiary was taken over by British-American Tobacco.[@TarHeel p. 362]

[^nationalized]: <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kichibei</span> was compensated massively for being pushed out of the industry and later founded a bank, among many other enterprises.[@JapanInTheTaishoEra p. 632]

> ## Traditional Methods of Manufacture
> Often manufactured by <span lang="ja-Latn">kuge</span> nobles,[@GrantsToKugeNobles] as they were very poor. Iwakura’s family had even resorted to renting out their house as a gambling den[@EmperorOfJapan p. 4] (although he was later very successful — he was excluded from the grants cited previously.)

### Taxation, Decline, and Revival

In 1902 a stamp duty was introduced that was inspired by similar taxes imposed in Western countries, the intent being to raise the cost of cards (and thereby dis&shy;cour&shy;age their use) but also to increase tax revenue. The tax imposed was crushing: 20 <span lang="ja-Latn">sen</span> per set,[^sen] in a time when cheap <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> decks could be had for as little as 2–3 <span lang="ja-Latn">sen</span>. The effect on card manufacturers was “dire”, as Rebecca Salter puts it.[@PopularJapanesePrints p. 186] <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ebashi</span> states that the law led to the closure of many small producers, and made it much harder for new manufacturers to enter the industry; both due to the tax itself as well as onerous record-keeping and inspection requirements.[@CartaTaxLawContents]

[^sen]: The <span lang="ja-Latn">sen</span> (<span lang="ja">銭</span>) was a unit of currency representing 1⁄100 of a <span lang="ja-Latn">yen</span>.

During this period, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> managed to survive in part by taking up the manufacture of regional patterns of Japanese cards (<span lang="ja">地方札</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">chihōfuda</span>), whose original, small-time, manufacturers had failed due to the new taxation law.[@NintendoHistory]

By the mid to late 20th century, interest in the game was waning. A poll by Japan’s Cabinet Office in 1956 indicated that only 9% of people played <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>, compared with 28% who played with Western playing cards.[@CabinetOfficeEntertainment]
Starting in the late 20th century, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> seems to have had something of a revival. “Character” decks featuring popular <span lang="ja-Latn">anime</span> and <span lang="ja-Latn">manga</span> characters began to be produced, and the popularity of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> has also been boosted by films featuring the cards, such as [<cite>Summer Wars</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Wars) (2009).

While Japan produces many new types of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> <em>cards</em>, in Korea <span class="noun" lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</span> <em>games</em> appear to be much more popular than their Japanese counterparts, and several films about gambling with <span class="noun" lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</span> — most prominently the [<cite lang="ko-Latn">Tazza</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazza:_The_High_Rollers) series (2006, 2014, 2019) — have been box-office successes.

Image search results on Instagram (as of writing in 2021) for the hashtags [`#花札`](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/%E8%8A%B1%E6%9C%AD/) and [`#화투`](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/%ED%99%94%ED%88%AC/) show about twice as many Korean-tagged images, despite Korea having only a third of the number of Instagram users that Japan has.[@JapaneseInstagramUsers][@KoreanInstagramUsers] The content of the images also gives many clues to the game’s popularity: Korean images often show games in progress, and many times being played for money, whereas Japanese images are often just of the cards themselves, focusing on their æsthetic value.

## The Art of the Cards

The culture of the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Edo</span> period in which <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> cards first appeared was heavily
in&shy;flu&shy;enced by the aristocratic culture of the earlier <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Heian</span> period. As such, the artwork on the cards abounds
with references to <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Heian</span> period literature,
festivals, and artistic tropes:

<blockquote class="blockquote">

With the exception of the peony, which entered the poetic canon in the <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Edo</span> period, all the images are from classical poetry of
the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Heian</span> period and reflect urban commoners’
knowledge of the poetic and cultural associations of the months.[@FourSeasons
loc. 1739–1741]

</blockquote>

Artistically, the cards derive from the <span lang="ja-Latn">kachō-ga</span>
(<span lang="ja">花鳥画</span> ‘flower and bird image’) tra&shy;dition. Artworks
created in this style often have poems written upon them, and these appear on
some cards of the <span lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> pattern.

## Hanafuda Patterns

A playing-card ‘pattern’ is a common set of designs that has been used by
multiple different manufacturers over a period of time. With <span
lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> there is now one primary or “standard” pattern:
all other patterns are referred to as ‘local cards’ (<span lang="ja">地方札</span>
<span lang="ja-Latn">chihōfuda</span>), and are considered to be specific to
a particular region. Most of these are of historical interest only and are no
longer manufactured, and there is little information about how gameplay differed
in different regions.


### Standard (<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hachihachi-bana</span>)

The standard pattern is now one that is called <Pronounce pronouncer="poyotan" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_八八花.mp3">hachihachi-bana</Pronounce> (<span lang="ja">八八花</span>/<span lang="ja">八々花</span>), since it was primarily used to play the game <span lang="ja">八八</span> ‘88’. Almost all decks use this pattern, and images from it are used to show the cards of each month below.

#### Korean deck differences

Korean decks are also based on the <span lang="ja-Latn">hachi­hachi­-bana</span> pattern, but the ribbons are usually blue instead of purple, and there is Korean text on the standard three red ribbons (labelled <span lang="ko">홍단</span>, <Pronounce lang="ko-Latn" pronouncer="glamstar77" file="pronunciation_ko_홍단.mp3">hongdan</Pronounce> ‘crimson ribbon’) and all three blue ribbons (<span lang="ko">청단</span>, <Pronounce lang="ko-Latn" pronouncer="glamstar77" file="pronunciation_ko_청단.mp3">cheongdan</Pronounce> ‘blue ribbon’).

> Korean <span class="noun" lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</span> cards with ribbons.

There are also differences in the ‘rain man’ (see below), and depending on the
deck, other aspects of the cards can also be translated into Korean cultural
terms. For example, the lesser cuckoo of the Japanese cards is in some decks the
Oriental magpie, which is the national bird of Korea.

### <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Mushi-bana</span>

The <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Mushi-bana</span> (<span lang="ja">虫花</span> ‘insect
flowers’) deck is a variant that contains only ten months, as it lacks the sixth
(peony) and seventh (bush clover). It is especially used for playing the game of
the same name, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Mushi</span> (‘insects’). It is sometimes
described as a shortened version of a standard <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hachihachi</span> deck, but in reality, it originated as a distinct
regional pattern.

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span> produced this pattern until recently, but
it now appears to be extinct.

>
> ![](nintendo_mushibana.jpg)
>
> <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nintendō</span>’s <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Mushi</span> pattern differs slightly from that of its standard deck.

### <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span>

The regional {% pronounce pronouncer="poyotan" word="Echigo-bana" lang="ja-Latn"
file="pronunciation_ja_越後花.mp3" %} (<span lang="ja">越後花</span> ‘Echigo
flowers’) pattern is based on designs that are older than the standard pattern.
The most obvious difference is that all the cards are overpainted with gold and
silver in various patterns.

Some of the <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> cards also carry short poems (<span

Japanese art — as seen on the <span lang="ja-Latn">kachō-ga</span> prints
above — and often provides more context to the images. The poems of the <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> will be examined in more detail below.

### <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-kobana</span>

The {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn" word="Echigo-kobana" file="pronunciation_ja_越後小花.mp3"
 pronouncer="poyotan" %} (<span lang="ja">越後小花</span> ‘Echigo small
flowers’) pattern is similar to the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span>, but
with very small cards measuring approximately 3&nbsp;cm × 4.5&nbsp;cm (1⅛″ ×
1¾″).

> The 5 Brights of the <span lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-kobana</span> pattern, by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi Tengudō</span>.

Because of the small size, there are no poems on this deck. However, it does
contain four extra cards. Any special rules for the deck, including the use of
these extra cards, are unknown — <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi Tengudō</span> even
includes a note with every deck sold asking for anyone who knows the rules to
contact them!

This is another regional pattern called {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn"
word="Awa­-bana" pronouncer="poyotan" file="pronunciation_ja_阿波花.mp3" %}
(<span lang="ja">阿波花</span>) or {% pronounce lang="ja-Latn"

(<span lang="ja">金時花</span>). It originated in <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Awa</span> province, in what is now <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Tokushima</span> prefecture.

Like the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> pattern, some of the <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Awa-­bana</span> carry poems (in fact, they carry the same
poems). The deck also contains an extra card which features the titular {%

### <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Dairen-bana</span>

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Dairen-bana</span> (<span lang="ja">大連花</span>) is an extinct regional pattern from the city of [<span class="noun" lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">Dalian</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalian) (<span lang="zh">大连市</span>) in China. It dates from the era of the [Kwangtung Leased Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwantung_Leased_Territory), when Japan occupied the region from 1905 until the end of WWII. The pattern possibly existed as a way to reduce government taxation on cards, as cards sold in occupied regions did not attract the same level of tax as those sold within Japan’s own islands.

The main distinguishing feature of the pattern is that each type of <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> card has a unique background pattern (as opposed to the usual ‘confetti’). The remainder of the cards follow the standard pattern very closely.

> [!figure]

> ![Three hanafuda cards: the first, with a red ribbon with writing on it, has a background consisting of a wave pattern, the second, with a red ribbon without writing, has a diagonal-striped background, and the third, with a blue ribbon, has a hatched background.](dairenbana.jpg)

### Modern/Novelty decks

In addition to the above, there are also many modern revisions or novelty decks
that do not conform to any one of the traditional patterns. More information and
examples of these can be found in the {%a new-manufacturers,article about new
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> manufacturers%}.

## The Cards in Depth

Firstly, a short note about the ordering of the deck: while nominally the cards start in ‘January’, at the time the deck was created Japan’s calendar was based upon the lunisolar Chinese calendar, which started in what is now February. This explains why ‘March’ is the month of the cherry blossom when — according to the current calendar — it should be April,[^peak] and why ‘August’ shows the full moon when the full moon festival (<span lang="ja">月見</span> {% pronounce pronouncer="skent" word="tsukimi" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_月見.mp3" %}) actually falls in September–October.

[^peak]: In Kyoto from the 11th to 13th centuries, the average peak of the cherry blossom season was April 17th.[@FourSeasons loc. 484]

However, even with these modifications the eleventh (willow) and twelfth (paulownia) months are in the wrong place. The eleventh month depicts rain, willows, and a frog, all of which are associated with summer.

In Korea, an altered ordering is used where the ‘November’ and ‘December’ months are switched. There is also another ordering used in Japan which might be called the “<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nagoya</span> ordering”, as it is used in several games from that region.[^fn3] This ordering (with differences in **bold**) is:

[^fn3]: Such as [Tensho](games/tensho/tensho.md).

<ol class="columnar">
<li>Pine</li>
<li><strong>Willow</strong></li>
<li>Cherry</li>
<li>Wisteria</li>
<li>Iris</li>
<li><strong>Paulownia</strong></li>
<li>Bush Clover</li>
<li>Miscanthus</li>

</ol>

The first month is represented by pine trees (<span lang="ja">松</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="_ai_" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_松.mp3">matsu</Pronounce>). The bright card shows a crane and pine trees, with the sun rising in the background. Both the crane and the pine are symbols of longevity, so they are a common combination in Japanese art; the mythical [Mount <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hōrai</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Penglai), a dwelling-place of immortals, is depicted as wooded with pine trees and populated by cranes.

The pine is associated with winter and snow, so these cards show the lingering
influence of winter during the new year. The first week of the new year is known
as the ‘pine week’ (<span lang="ja">松の内</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">matsu no
uchi</span>), and the traditional festival that was held on the first Day of the
Rat of the new year (<span lang="ja">子の日の宴</span> <span
lang="ja-Latn">nenohi no en</span>) involved uprooting small pine
trees.[@WorldOfTheShiningPrince p. 168]

The text on the <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> reads <span lang="ja-Latn">akayoroshi</span> <span lang="ja">あ𛀙よろし</span>.[^hentaigana] This means ‘red is good’ and was an older name of a <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hachi-Hachi</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> (scoring com&shy;bin&shy;ation) which is now called <span lang="ja-Latn">akatan</span>.[^unclear] Cards from vintage decks can carry older names for this <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span>, such as <span lang="ja-Latn">urasu</span>, or sometimes simply <span lang="ja">正月/初月</span>, indicating the first lunar month.

[^hentaigana]: The writing on the <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> uses a rare <span lang="ja-Latn">hentaigana</span> character for <span lang="ja-Latn">ka</span>, which is usually written <span lang="ja">か</span>. It may not render correctly on your device.

[^unclear]: The meaning of this phrase is usually said to be “unclear”, even by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> manufacturers. Some derive a meaning like ‘clearly good’ based on reading <span lang="ja-Latn">aka</span> as a short form of <span lang="ja-Latn">akiraka ni</span> (‘clearly’). However, old listings of <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> show <span lang="ja-Latn">akayoroshi</span> alongside <span lang="ja-Latn">aoyoroshi</span> (‘blue is good’) indicating that <span lang="ja-Latn">aka</span> should be read straightforwardly as <span lang="ja">赤</span> (‘red’).

In the <span lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> pattern, the <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> cards carry a <span lang="ja-Latn">tanka</span> composed by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">[Mina­moto no Mune­yuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minamoto_no_Muneyuki)</span>[^minamoto] (<span lang="ja">源宗于</span>) at a poetry competition organized by the Empress during the reign of Emperor <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Uda</span> .

There is one <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card, one <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> card (with text), and two <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> cards. The text on the <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> is the same as that on January’s.

The second month is represented by plum trees in blossom (<span lang="ja">梅</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_梅.mp3">ume</Pronounce>). The <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> has a bush warbler–plum blossom combination that has been associated with spring since very early times, dating at least from the <Pronounce pronouncer="monekuson" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_万葉集.mp3" noun="true">Man’yōshū</Pronounce> (<cite lang="ja">万葉集</cite> ‘Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves’, a book of poetry compiled during the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nara</span> period sometime after 759).[@FourSeasons loc. 978]

Despite being a tree introduced from China, the plum blossom was the favoured flower in poetry and art during the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nara</span> period; the native cherry blossom would only become more popular during the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Heian</span> period:[@FourSeasons loc. 997] after a famous plum tree that was planted by Emperor <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kanmu</span> at the imperial palace had died, Emperor <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ninmyō</span> replaced it with a cherry tree[^cherrytree] in 834.[@HandbookForJapan p. 301]

[^cherrytree]: This cherry tree has been replanted several times since then, and is called the <span lang="ja-Latn">sakon no sakura</span> (<span lang="ja">左近桜</span> ‘left-side cherry’).

The bush warbler (<span lang="ja">鶯</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">uguisu</span>) was praised for its song, and one of its cries is said to repeat the phrase <span lang="ja-Latn">hō-hoke-kyō</span>, the Japanese name of the [Lotus Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Sutra) (<span lang="ja">法華経</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">hokekyō</span>).

The poem on the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> <span

all <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> patterns depict red plum blossoms

The third month is represented by cherry trees in bloom (<span lang="ja">桜</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" lang="ja-Latn" file='pronunciation_ja_桜.mp3'>sakura</Pronounce>). Blossom-viewing (<span lang="ja">花見</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="samchie" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_花見.mp3">hanami</Pronounce>), parti­cularly of cherry blossoms, is a custom that dates back to the Heian period. The curtains (<span lang="ja">幕</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="skent" lang="ja-Latn" file='pronunciation_ja_幕.mp3'>maku</Pronounce>) that are shown on the bright card are there provide privacy whilst viewing cherry blossoms. An example of their use can be seen in the image on the left. It was common to use striped fabric, particularly in red &amp; white, while nobility would use curtains bearing their family crest.

The <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> of the March cards reads <span lang="ja-Latn">mi&shy;yoshino</span> <span lang="ja">みよしの</span> ‘beautiful <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yoshino</span>’,[^fn4] which is a sobriquet for the mountainous area of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yoshino</span> (<span lang="ja">吉野</span>) in <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Nara</span> prefecture, famous for its cherry blossoms. The term <span lang="ja-Latn">miyoshino</span> is [often used to refer to this location](http://www.wakapoetry.net/?s=miyosino) in the imperial poetry collections.

[^fn4]: Some older cards spell this phrase differently, some examples are: <span lang="ja">みよし𛂙</span>, <span lang="ja">美よし𛂙</span>, or <span lang="ja">みよし𛂜</span>. Other phrases seen on the cherry <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> include <span lang="ja"> す𛀙𛂦𛃰</span> (<span lang="ja">すがわら</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">sugawara</span>), or <span lang="ja">宇良す</span> (<span lang="ja">うらす</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">urasu</span>). Both of these are references to the [Hachi-Hachi](games/hachi-hachi/hachi-hachi.md) <span lang="ja-Latn">yaku</span> ‘<span lang="ja">うらすがわら</span>’ (<span lang="ja-Latn">urasugawara</span>). 

In 1688, [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Matsuo
Bashō</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsuo_Bash%C5%8D) (<span lang="ja">松尾芭蕉</span>),
Japan’s most famed composer of <span lang="ja-Latn">hokku</span>, visited <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yoshino</span> during
his travels but found himself unable to compose a single poem, overwhelmed by
the pressure of trying to live up to his predecessors.[@NarrowRoad p. 84] One of
them, <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yasuhara Teishitsu</span> (<span lang="ja">安原貞室</span>), had composed what <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Bashō</span> considered to be

The fourth month is represented by wisteria (<span lang="ja">藤</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="kaoring" lang="ja-Latn" file='pronunciation_ja_藤.mp3'>fuji</Pronounce>). These cards are also nicknamed ‘black bean’ (<span lang="ja">黒豆</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="usako_usagiclub" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_黒豆.mp3">kuromame</Pronounce>), due to their appearance. This month shows the tran&shy;sition from spring to summer; the lesser cuckoo (<span lang="ja">ホトトギス</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="forsmith" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_ホトトギス.mp3">hototogisu</Pronounce>) is a bird of summer,[@FourSeasons loc. 1065] while wisteria is associated with the passage of spring into summer;[@FourSeasons loc. 1021] it is also known as the ‘two-season plant’ (<span lang="ja">二季草</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">niki&shy;sou</span>). Like the bush warbler and spring, the first cry of the cuckoo was considered to announce the beginning of summer. By the time of the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Edo</span> period, this was perhaps more of a poetic dream than reality; the poet [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Buson</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosa_Buson) remarked that he had only heard the bird twice, despite living in Kyoto for 20 years.[@TheClassicTraditionOfHaiku 56]

The cuckoo swooping in front of the moon is a common motif in Japanese art. It is tempting to claim that this may be a reference to the tale of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Yorimasa</span> from the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Heike Monogatari</span>,[@HeikeMonogatari pp. 161–3] but the oldest decks do not have a moon on this card.

The <span lang="ja-Latn">tanka</span> on the <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> cards is similar to Poem 135 from the Summer section of the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kokinshū</span>,[^differs] perhaps written by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kakinomoto no Hitomaro</span> <span lang="ja">柿本 人麻呂</span>. The poem again focuses on the transition from spring (represented by wisteria) to summer (represented by the arrival of the cuckoo):

[^differs]: The poem on the card differs slightly in that the last line starts with <span lang="ja-Latn">ima ya</span> <span lang="ja">今や</span> instead of <span lang="ja-Latn">itu ka</span> <span lang="ja">いつか</span>.[@PoemsOfTheEchigobana p. 100]

In Korean contexts, the non-<span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> wisteria cards are almost always shown upside-down, so that the plants are presented in the same manner as the bush clover in the seventh month. The cards are also referred to as <span lang="ko">흑싸리</span>, “black bush clover”, possibly because wisteria is not native to Korea. The <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card is never shown inverted.

The fifth month is represented by iris (<span lang="ja">菖蒲</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_菖蒲.mp3">ayame</Pronounce>); a nickname for the month is <Pronounce pronouncer="skent" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_葱.mp3">negi</Pronounce> (<span lang="ja">葱</span>, ‘scallion/leek’).[@HanaAwase]

The bridge shown on the <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card is a reference to the ‘eight bridges’ (<span lang="ja">八橋</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="poyotan" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_八橋.mp3">yatsu&shy;hashi</Pronounce>) featured in an episode of the [<cite>Tales of Ise</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tales_of_Ise) (<cite lang="ja"> 伊勢物語</cite> <span lang="ja-Latn">Ise Monogatari</span>), in which the unnamed protagonist[^assumed] of the story comes across a braided river that is crossed by overlapping planks forming a zig-zag bridge. Challenged to compose a poem on the subject “a traveller’s sentiments”, he recites the following:

[^assumed]: Traditionally this is presumed to be the poet [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ariwara no Narihira</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariwara_no_Narihira) (<span lang="ja">在原 業平</span>).

This poem, which appears in full on the <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> cards of the <span lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> pattern,[@PoemsOfTheEchigobana p. 100] is in the form of an acrostic; the first letters of each line spell out <span lang="ja-Latn">kakitsuhata</span> <span lang="ja">かきつはた</span>, which is the name of the Japanese iris (<span lang="ja">杜若</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="kaoring" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_カキツバタ.mp3">kakitsubata</Pronounce>).[^writtenja] Because of this scene, the iris and the planked bridge have a long association in Japan.

The sixth month is represented by the tree peony (<span lang="ja">牡丹</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="ryomasakamoto" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_牡丹.mp3">botan</Pronounce>). The peony was a much later introduction to Japan than the plants shown on the other cards, being brought over from China in the 8th century.[@FlowersAndGardensOfJapan p. 159]

The flower was considered to be almost too bold for poetry, and those poems
which do exist usually mention its striking colour, size, or Chinese origins.

> One common species of bush clover in Japan is [<cite>Lespedeza thunbergii</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lespedeza_thunbergii), named after the Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg who visited Japan from 1775–6. Oddly enough, Thunberg also collected some <span lang="ja-Latn">karuta</span> decks during his stay, and was probably the first European to take one back to Europe. His decks are now [in the Swedish Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm](http://collections.smvk.se/carlotta-em/web/object/1000639). (Thanks to Marcus Richert for pointing out this connection.)

The seventh month is represented by bush clover (<span lang="ja">萩</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_萩.mp3">hagi</Pronounce>). These cards are also nicknamed ‘red bean’ (<span lang="ja">赤豆</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">akamame</span>/<span lang="ja">小豆</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="poyotan" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_赤豆.mp3">azuki</Pronounce>). Bush clover is very strongly associated with autumn — the Japanese character <span lang="ja">萩</span> is a composition of <span lang="ja">秋</span> ‘autumn’ and <span lang="ja">艹</span> (full form <span lang="ja">艸</span>) ‘grass’.

Bush clover is also (along with miscanthus, see the next month) considered one of the “seven flowers of autumn” (<span lang="ja">秋の七草</span>), a term which derives from a pair of poems in the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Man’yōshū</span> (book 8:1537–8):[@TheManyoshu p. 212]

<div class="multi">
    <p>
    The flowers that blow<br />
    In the autumn fields<br />
    When I count them on my fingers,<br />
    There they are—<br />
    The flowers of seven kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
    They are the bush-clover,<br />
    The ‘tail flower’, the flowers<br />
    Of the kuzu vine and patrinia,<br />
    The fringed pink, and the agrimony,<br />
    And last the blithe ‘morning face’.
    </p>
</div>

The bush clover is referred to in the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Man’yōshū</span> even
more than the plum or cherry blossoms.[@ElementsOfJapaneseDesign p. 54]

On the other hand, the wild boar pictured on the <span
lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card does not feature in any of the imperial poetry
collections. As a representative of rural life, it was considered to be outside
the boundaries of the aristocratic worldview of the poets. For the common
people, however, the boar was very important as a source of food. When [Emperor
Tenmu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Tenmu) banned the consumption of
meat in 675, only cattle, horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens were
prohibited.[@FourSeasons loc. 4261] Wild game such as boar and deer were not
included: either they escaped the imagination of the Emperor, or they were too
important as food sources for commoners.

{/* Deer is associated with bush clover but instead we have a boar? But also deer are renowned for being separated from their lovers... */}

The eighth month is represented by miscanthus or silvergrass (<span lang="ja">芒/薄</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="kaoring" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_スズキ.mp3">susuki</Pronounce>). It can also be called <span lang="ja-Latn">tsuki</span> (<span lang="ja">月</span>, ‘moon’),[@WanderingWords p. 194] or <span lang="ja-Latn">oka</span> (<span lang="ja">丘</span> ‘hill’).[@FolkloreAndSymbolismOfFlowersPlantsAndTrees p. 107]

The bold moon card is possibly the most well-recognized of all <span lang="ja-Latn">hanafuda</span> cards. It is the standard card chosen as a representative emoji: 🎴 On printed cards, the fields of grass are often simplified into solid black circles. Because of the resemblance of this to the head of a bald man, another nickname for this month is ‘baldy’ (<span lang="ja"> 坊主</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="skpronounce" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_坊主.mp3">bōzu</Pronounce>), a slang term for a Buddhist monk.

Traditionally, the most important date of the year for moon viewing was the 15th
day of the 8th month (<span lang="ja">中秋観月</span> <span
lang="ja-Latn">chūshū kangetsu</span>);[@WorldOfTheShiningPrince p. 176] the
full moon always fell on the 15th due to the way the calendar was
constructed.[@WorldOfTheShiningPrince p. 170]

During the festival, chrysanthemum petals are added to <span lang="ja-Latn">sake</span> and consumed. The sake cup (<span lang="ja">杯</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">sakazuki</span>) pictured on the card has the character <span lang="ja">壽/寿</span> (<Pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_寿.mp3">kotobuki</Pronounce>), meaning ‘long life’, written on it in a cursive script.

A poem by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Bashō</span> commemorates the evening of the 9th day of the 9th month, in 1691. He was staying at the temple <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Gichu-ji</span> (<span lang="ja">義仲寺</span>) in a hermitage known as ‘name&shy;less hut’ (<span lang="ja">無名庵</span> <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Mumyō-an</span>), when his disciple <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kawai Otokuni</span> (<span lang="ja">河合乙州</span>) came to visit him with a gift:

Chrysanthemums were also prized for their secular beauty, and collectors
competed to breed particularly beautiful varieties.

The chrysanthemum is also used as a symbol by the Emperor of Japan. It was first
adopted by [Emperor <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Go-Toba</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Toba)
(<abbr title="reigned">r.</abbr> 1183–1198), but was not restricted to this
purpose until the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</span> period. In modern times a
stylized version of the chrysanthemum flower is used as the Chrysanthemum Seal
(<span lang="ja">菊紋</span> <span lang="ja-Latn">kikumon</span>), which is the
crest of the Emperor of Japan (who uses a 16-petal version) and other members of
the imperial family (who use a 14-petal version).

> The cards for November show willow trees. There is one bright card, one <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card, one red <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> card, and one <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> card.

The eleventh month is represented by willow (<span lang="ja">柳</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_柳.mp3">yanagi</Pronounce>); it is also often referred to as ‘rain’ (<span lang="ja">雨</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="strawberrybrown" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_雨.mp3">ame</Pronounce>) or ‘drizzle’ (<span lang="ja"> 時雨</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_時雨.mp3">shigure</Pronounce>).

These cards have a strange relationship with the other cards — in many games they have special powers, or they are valued lower than the cards of other months. For ex&shy;ample, the bright of November will often score less than the other four brights, and in some games the “lightning card” has special powers, such as being able to match any other card.

The man pictured on the bright card is the poet <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ono no Michikaze</span> (<span lang="ja">小野道風</span>), who is considered to be one of the founders of Japanese calligraphy. The jumping frog re&shy;calls an episode in his life: he had failed seven times to achieve a promotion and was considering abandoning his attempts. One day, walking beside a stream, he saw a frog attempting to jump onto a willow branch. Seven times it jumped, and seven times it failed. On the eighth attempt, the frog reached the branch successfully. <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Michikaze</span> was thus inspired to persevere with his attempts.[@AnimalInFarEasternArt pp. 86–7]

On older decks, a different “rain man” is pictured. On these cards, the man is
running in the rain with the umbrella closed around his head. This feature is
preserved in the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-bana</span> pattern.

On the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Echigo-kobana</span>’s “rain man” card, the figure has a bushy tail and appears to be either a <span lang="ja-Latn">kitsune</span>, a Japanese fox/spirit; or a <span lang="ja-Latn">tanuki</span>, the raccoon-dog. I am not sure of the significance of this.

The “lightning card” mentioned above is the red-coloured <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> card, which is usually called the ogre card in Japanese (<span lang="ja">鬼札</span> {%pronounce  pronouncer="strawberrybrown" word="onifuda" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_鬼札.mp3" %}). The drums, which are visible in some patterns, are an attribute of the thunder god {% pronounce noun="true" lang="ja-Latn" word="Raijin" pronouncer="kaori410f" file="pronunciation_ja_雷神.mp3" %} (<span lang="ja">雷神</span>).

The twelfth month is represented by paulownia (<span lang="ja">桐</span>
<Pronounce pronouncer="kaoring"  lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_桐.mp3">kiri</Pronounce>).
This is a tree that flowers in spring, and has large heart-shaped leaves.

The paulownia as a symbol was originally used by the imperial family and ranked
second only to the chrysanthemum. Permission to use the paulownia was granted by [Emperor
<span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Go-Daigo</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Daigo)
to [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ashikaga
Takauji</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashikaga_Takauji), whose
descendants used it until the end of the [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ashikaga</span>
shogunate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashikaga_shogunate) in 1573. After
this, [Emperor <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Go-Yōzei</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Y%C5%8Dzei)
granted use of the crest to [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi
Hideyoshi</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi) (1537–1598),
the second of the three “Great Unifiers” of Japan, and today it is most strongly
associated with the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</span> family. However, as
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Toyotomi</span> in turn allowed its use by so many of his
allies, it is also now the most common crest in Japan.

In modern times, the paulownia symbol is also associated with the government.
This use started after the <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Meiji</span> restoration, and it
appears on the seal of the prime minister’s office. There are many versions of
the crest, with the 3–5–3 flower version being the most common. The 5-7–5 version is
of higher standing and is the one used by the government.

The wood of the paulownia is light and strong and often used for boxes; it is
very fast-growing and also somewhat fire-proof, so was useful as a storage
material. Older high-quality <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> decks came
encased in an outer box of paulownia wood. The manufacturer <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Ōishi Tengudo</span> still boxes many of their decks in this way.

The phoenix (<span lang="ja">鳳凰</span> <Pronounce pronouncer="akitomo" lang="ja-Latn" file="pronunciation_ja_鳳凰.mp3">hōō</Pronounce>, or <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">fèng&shy;huáng</span> in Mandarin Chinese) featured on the bright card is from Japanese mythology, and was traditionally associated with the empress of Japan. According to legend, the phoenix will only land on a paulownia tree. What appear to be ‘spikes’ on the card are really its long tail feathers. This card is sometimes casually referred to as the “rooster” card.

One of the <span lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> cards is usually coloured, often yellow, but sometimes with red as well. In some games it becomes a <span lang="ja-Latn">tane</span> card, or even a <span lang="ja-Latn">tanzaku</span> card.

Usually (in Japanese decks) the manufacturer’s mark is on the coloured <span
lang="ja-Latn">kasu</span> card, much like the ace of spades is used in European
decks. In Korean decks, the mark can also be on the full moon card or the
jokers.
