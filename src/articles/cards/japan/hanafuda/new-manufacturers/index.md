title: New Hanafuda Brands
order: 4
---

In the internet era there are now many <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun>
brands that are produced on a small scale. Most of the production is outsourced
to larger firms, and the designs aren’t made by the themselves. Thanks to the
rise of crowdfunding, the variety of designs has greatly expanded from the
traditional patterns.

## [Blank’s Art Project](https://blankproject.kr/)

Blank’s Art Project have created several Hwatu decks with custom art:
<strong>Pebble</strong> (2016), Golden Toad (2018 & 2019 editions, crowdfunded
on Korean site ‘wadiz’), and Pebble Film Edition (2019). They have also created
custom promotional decks for Jeju beer (2017).

## [Hanafuda Hawaii](http://www.hanafudahawaii.com/)

Produces two different decks: Hanafuda Hawai‘i Style (2009), and Hanafuda Nā Pua
Hawai‘i (2016).

**Hanafuda Hawai‘i Style** recreates the traditional Japanese deck with bold
artwork, including scores printed on the cards and with helpful icons to
identify scoring combinations on the cards. In the rules given with the deck,
there are not “5 Brights”, so the “4 Brights” are reproduced here:

The cards of November show more of the style of the cards (note the ‘rain man’
is worth a mere 5 points with the Hawaiian rules):

**Hanafuda Nā Pua Hawai‘i** is probably my favourite of all the modern <Noun
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> decks. It recontextualizes the game with the
flora and fauna native to Hawai‘i, matching visual puns to the bold art of the
Hawai‘i Style deck: in the month of March, for example, the cherry blossoms
become <span lang="haw">‘iliahi</span> (sandalwood) flowers, and the curtain
becomes the traditional <span lang="haw">kapa</span> cloth.

## [Indianwolf Studios](http://www.indianwolfstudios.com/)

Indianwolf have so far produced the [<Noun lang="ja-Latn"><strong>Hanami
Hanafuda</strong></Noun>](http://www.indianwolfstudios.com/hanami.html) (2018)
and [<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Sensu
Hanafuda</Noun>](http://www.indianwolfstudios.com/sensu.html) (2019) decks, in
poker-sized cards printed by Legends Playing Card Company. Both of these are

After another successful Kickstarter campaign, Indianwolf also produced the
[<strong>Night
Parade</strong>](http://www.indianwolfstudios.com/night-parade-fusion.html) deck
(2020). The four cards of each month combine to form one wide tetraptych. The
deck is themed upon traditional Japanese monsters (<span
lang="ja-Latn">yōkai</span>), and it also comes with rules for a new game called
“[Orochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamata_no_Orochi)”.

## [<span lang="ko">자매상점</span> (jamaistore)](https://www.instagram.com/jamaistore/)

Jamaistore produces ridiculously-cute cat &amp; dog themed <span
lang="ko-Latn">hwatu</span> decks. Each of them comes with an additional six
joker cards, appropriate to the theme. Both decks were crowdfunded on the Korean
site ‘tumblbug’.

Jamaistore’s <span lang="ko">냥투</span> (<span lang="ko-Latn">nyangtu</span>, ‘meow fight’) deck (2016).<br />

The name is a pun on <span lang="ko-Latn">hwatu</span> with the Korean <span lang="ko-Latn">nyang</span> meaning ‘meow’.

## [Modern Hanafuda](http://www.modernhanafuda.net/)

**Modern Hanafuda** (2012) was one of the earliest Kickstarted
<Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> decks. It was designed by Sarah Thomas, and
the cards are decorated with bold flat colours and geometric patterns. The cards
are larger and longer than normal playing cards.

The first edition is called the <strong>Phoenix</strong> deck (2019). Each
different type of <Noun lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</Noun> card has a different

pixel grid. The full set includes two decks, one each with black and red
borders, and an additional 12 cards with
“[palette-swapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_swap)” colours, as an

to play or invent new games; the set also includes rules for three original
games invented by Ryan.

## [Tuhwa (<span lang="ko">투화</span>)](http://utmost.co.kr/portfolio/flower-war/)

This deck was designed by Korean design firm Utmost, and was first [crowdfunded
on wadiz](https://www.wadiz.kr/web/campaign/detail/21803). The name is a
reversal of the standard Korean name <Noun lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</Noun> (<span
lang="ko">화투</span>). There are several editions of the deck
available — <strong>[v2](http://utmost.co.kr/portfolio/flower-war/)</strong>
(2018) and <strong>[v3](http://utmost.co.kr/portfolio/flowerwar2020/)</strong>
(2020) (“v1” appears to have been a small or private printing) — and each
features different art based on traditional Korean art styles. The cards are
much larger than those in a standard deck, and are made of plastic like other
Korean decks.
