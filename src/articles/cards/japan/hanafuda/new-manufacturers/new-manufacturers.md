In the internet era there are now many <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>
brands that are produced on a small scale. Most of the production is outsourced
to larger firms, and the designs aren’t made by the themselves. Thanks to the
rise of crowdfunding, the variety of designs has greatly expanded from the
traditional patterns.

## [Blank’s Art Project](https://blankproject.kr/)

Blank’s Art Project have created several Hwatu decks with custom art:
<strong>Pebble</strong> (2016), Golden Toad (2018 & 2019 editions, crowdfunded
on Korean site ‘wadiz’), and Pebble Film Edition (2019). They have also created
custom promotional decks for Jeju beer (2017).

## [Hanafuda Hawaii](http://www.hanafudahawaii.com/)

Produces two different decks: Hanafuda Hawai‘i Style (2009), and Hanafuda Nā Pua
Hawai‘i (2016).

**Hanafuda Hawai‘i Style** recreates the traditional Japanese deck with bold
artwork, including scores printed on the cards and with helpful icons to
identify scoring combinations on the cards. In the rules given with the deck,
there are not “5 Brights”, so the “4 Brights” are reproduced here:

The cards of November show more of the style of the cards (note the ‘rain man’
is worth a mere 5 points with the Hawaiian rules):

**Hanafuda Nā Pua Hawai‘i** is probably my favourite of all the modern <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> decks. It recontextualizes the game with the
flora and fauna native to Hawai‘i, matching visual puns to the bold art of the
Hawai‘i Style deck: in the month of March, for example, the cherry blossoms
become <span lang="haw">‘iliahi</span> (sandalwood) flowers, and the curtain
becomes the traditional <span lang="haw">kapa</span> cloth.

## [Indianwolf Studios](http://www.indianwolfstudios.com/)

Indianwolf have so far produced the [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn"><strong>Hanami
Hanafuda</strong></span>](http://www.indianwolfstudios.com/hanami.html) (2018)
and [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Sensu
Hanafuda</span>](http://www.indianwolfstudios.com/sensu.html) (2019) decks, in
poker-sized cards printed by Legends Playing Card Company. Both of these are
available in a plain version, or one that has indices to aid new players.

After another successful Kickstarter campaign, Indianwolf also produced the
[<strong>Night
Parade</strong>](http://www.indianwolfstudios.com/night-parade-fusion.html) deck
(2020). The four cards of each month combine to form one wide tetraptych. The
deck is themed upon traditional Japanese monsters (<span
lang="ja-Latn">yōkai</span>), and it also comes with rules for a new game called
“[Orochi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamata_no_Orochi)”.

## [<span lang="ko">자매상점</span> (jamaistore)](https://www.instagram.com/jamaistore/)

Jamaistore produces ridiculously-cute cat &amp; dog themed <span
lang="ko-Latn">hwatu</span> decks. Each of them comes with an additional six
joker cards, appropriate to the theme. Both decks were crowdfunded on the Korean
site ‘tumblbug’.

## [Modern Hanafuda](http://www.modernhanafuda.net/)

**Modern Hanafuda** (2012) was one of the earliest Kickstarted
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> decks. It was designed by Sarah Thomas, and
the cards are decorated with bold flat colours and geometric patterns. The cards
are larger and longer than normal playing cards.

## [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">NISHIKI</span> <span lang="ja">錦</span>](https://www.etsy.com/shop/nishikie)

This redesign by <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanako</span> of [estudio
artes](http://www.estudio-artes.com/) produced the only 3-way standard/<span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>/<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kabufuda</span> deck that I
know of, which is printed on poker-sized cards. There is also a <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>-only deck, in a traditional format.

## Cochae

Japanese paper design house Cochae produces [<strong
lang="ja-Latn">Kokoyo</strong>](http://www.cochae.com/system/goods/2359/)
(2019), a deck with bold, crisp visuals and faces on everything. The cards are
coded by background colour so that Bright cards have a gold background, Tane
have silver, etc.

## [Junior](https://www.junior.cards/)

Junior have produced a ground-up redesign of Hanafuda into a poker format deck, printed by <abbr title="the United States Playing Card Company">USPCC</abbr>.  The first edition is called the <strong>Phoenix</strong> deck (2019). Each different type of <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> card has a different background, and all are identified by suit marker indices, which helps to clarify the cards for new players.

To fill out the full 54 cards of a standard poker deck, there are an additional
6 ‘bamboo’ cards including an additional <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Fuji</span> Bright
and second Oni card:[^fn0]

[^fn0]: These were inspired by the extra cards of the Universal deck.

After the successful completion of [the Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/juniorcards/junior-hanafuda) in 2020, two more Junior decks were produced: <strong>Dragon</strong> and <strong>Tiger</strong>.

## Pixel Hanafuda

Ryan Sartor has produced <strong>Pixel Hanafuda</strong>, which is currently
available from [The Game
Crafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/pixel-hanafuda). The art is
inspired by 8- &amp; 16-bit video games, and the cards are designed with a 29×44
pixel grid. The full set includes two decks, one each with black and red
borders, and an additional 12 cards with
“[palette-swapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_swap)” colours, as an
homage to the artistic techniques of the era. These additional cards can be used
to play or invent new games; the set also includes rules for three original
games invented by Ryan.

## [Tuhwa (<span lang="ko">투화</span>)](http://utmost.co.kr/portfolio/flower-war/)

This deck was designed by Korean design firm Utmost, and was first [crowdfunded
on wadiz](https://www.wadiz.kr/web/campaign/detail/21803). The name is a
reversal of the standard Korean name <span class="noun" lang="ko-Latn">Hwatu</span> (<span
lang="ko">화투</span>). There are several editions of the deck
available — <strong>[v2](http://utmost.co.kr/portfolio/flower-war/)</strong>
(2018) and <strong>[v3](http://utmost.co.kr/portfolio/flowerwar2020/)</strong>
(2020) (“v1” appears to have been a small or private printing) — and each
features different art based on traditional Korean art styles. The cards are
much larger than those in a standard deck, and are made of plastic like other
Korean decks.
