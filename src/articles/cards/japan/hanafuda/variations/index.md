## Formosa Flowers

Formosa Flowers is a board game published by [Soso
Studio](https://www.sosostudio.com/) that adapts the <span class="noun"
lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> deck to Taiwanese flowers and customs, and comes
with a fresh ruleset developed for the cards.

## <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hana-Awase</span>: Japanese Flower MEMO

<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hana-Awase</span> is a tile-based version that uses the
<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span> deck to play “memory”-style games. It has
several levels of difficulty to suit children from ages 2 up.

The art was designed with consultation from <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Ebashi
Takashi</span> in order to produce art with colours consistent with traditional
Japanese dye-making techniques.
