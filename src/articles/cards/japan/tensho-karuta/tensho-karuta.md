<span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Tenshō Karuta</span> (<span lang="ja">天正かる た</span>) is the earliest known type of playing-card deck native to Japan, appearing during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensh%C5%8D_(Momoyama_period)"><span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Tenshō</span> period</a> (1573–1592). It recreated precisely the Portuguese decks of the period, retaining the imagery and composition of the originals.

In 1597 there is a reference in the records of the [<span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Chōsokabe</span> family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8Dsokabe_clan) (<span lang="ja">長宗我部氏</span>) that describes soldiers playing with cards.[@DragonsOfPortugal p. 43]

In 1636 the Portuguese were excluded from mainland Japan and in 1639 they were
expelled from the country entirely. <span lang="ja-Latn"
class="noun">Tenshō</span> cards were made illegal in 1648.[@DragonsOfPortugal

### <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Unsun Karuta</span> (<span lang="ja">うんすんかるた</span>)

The Unsun Karuta becomes much more Japanese. It adds three new ranks, and a new suit.

### <span lang="ja-Latn" class="noun">Sunkun Karuta</span> (<span lang="ja">すんくんかるた</span>)


Sunkun adds another rank and suit, and one additional card.

Both types of card were banned in the 1790s.
