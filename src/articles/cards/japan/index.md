After being introduced by Portuguese sailors and merchants in the late 16th
century,[@DragonsOfPortugal] playing cards in Japan underwent a long period of
“speciation” due to the isolationist [<span
lang="ja-Latn">sakoku</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku) (<span
lang="ja">鎖国</span>, ‘closed country’) policy of the <span lang="ja-Latn"
class="noun">Tokugawa</span> shōgunate which severely limited contact with the
outside world for over 200 years.

Cut off from their original source, these playing cards were developed in
new and surprising ways. Decks were increased in complexity by adding more ranks
or additional suits. Later on, new variants were introduced to circumvent
anti-gambling laws, to obscure the true nature of the cards as gambling
implements, or to simplify existing decks by removing suits or ranks.

There are two main families of cards, and a third probably derived from both of
these:

1. Cards derived from Portuguese patterns, with suits and ranks. In order of
  appearance these are:
    * [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tenshō Karuta</span> (<span lang="ja">
      天正カルタ</span>, ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Tenshō</span>
      cards’)](/articles/cards/japan/tensho-karuta/), closely followed by:
      * <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Unsun Karuta</span> (<span lang="ja">うんすんかるた
        </span>, ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Un-Sun</span> cards’)
      * <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Sunkun Karuta</span> (<span lang="ja">すんくんかるた
        </span>, ‘<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Sun-Kun</span> cards’)
    * <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Mekuri Karuta</span> (<span lang="ja">捲りかるた
      </span>, ‘turning cards’) were an alteration of the <span class="noun"
      lang="ja-Latn">Tenshō</span> pattern cards, probably to evade bans on
      those cards. The structure of the deck remains the same, but there are
      many different regional artwork patterns.
    * [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Kabu
      Karuta</span>](/articles/cards/japan/kabu-karuta/) (<span lang="ja">株かる
      た</span>) were a further simplification of <span
      lang="ja-Latn">mekuri</span> cards, eliminating all suits except for one,
      which is replicated four times. Like <span lang="ja-Latn">mekuri</span>
      cards, there are many regional varieties, but <span
      lang="ja-Latn">kabufuda</span> is the only one still in mass production.
2. Cards used for simpler matching games, not organized into suits or ranks:
    * <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Uta-garuta</span> (<span lang="ja">歌かるた</span>,
      ‘poetry cards’)
    * <span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Iroha-garuta</span> (<span lang="ja">いろはかるた
      </span>, ‘alphabet cards’)
3. [<span class="noun" lang="ja-Latn">Hanafuda</span>](/articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/) (<span
  lang="ja">花札</span>, ‘flower cards’) are derived from a combination of both
  the Portuguese and the matching-type cards.
