Money cards.

## The Historical Water Margin Deck

Money cards are probably the oldest types of cards in the world, and from them
are derived many other types of cards, probably including “standard” playing
cards, as well as games like mahjong, along with more obvious descendants like
[ceki cards](/articles/cards/ceki).

### <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lù Róng</span>’s “Water Margin” deck

The earliest definite written description of these cards comes from the Chinese
scholar [<span class="noun" lang="zh-Latn">Lù
Róng</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Rong) (<span lang="zh">陆容
</span>, 1436–1494). In his book <cite lang="zh">菽园杂记</cite>
(<cite>Miscellaneous Records from the Bean Garden</cite>), he writes:

> In my native city of [Kunshan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunshan),
> everyone knows how to play cards, from scholar-officials to children. I spent
> eight years in the government at Kunshan, but I did not know how to play, and
> people sneered at me for my stupidity. Recently I have been able to look at
> their shape and make. There is one card each from 1 cash [<span
> lang="zh-Hant">錢</span>/<span lang="zh-Hans">钱</span>] to 9 cash, and one
> card each from 100 cash to 900 cash. Beginning from the 10,000 <span
> lang="zh-Latn">guan</span> [<span lang="zh">貫</span>] card, there are figures
> drawn on each.[@GameOfLeaves p. 405]

The list of figures given by <span class="noun" lang="zh-Latn">Lù Róng</span>
is as follows. The Chinese text can be exactly recovered by reading across each
row.[@LuRong p. 90–91]

Thus, <span class="noun" lang="zh-Latn">Lù Róng</span> describes a deck of 38 cards:

- 1–9 錢
- 100–900 錢
- 10,000–90,000 貫
- 200,000–900,000 貫
- 1,000,000 貫
- 10,000,000 貫
- 100,000,000 貫

In modern times, these cards are often referred to as “<cite>Water Margin</cite>
cards”, but in fact, <span class="noun" lang="zh-Latn">Lù Róng</span> does not
cite <cite>Water Margin</cite> at all. Instead he writes:{%fn%}The fact that
<span class="noun" lang="zh-Latn">Lù Róng</span> doesn’t know of the existence
of <cite>Water Margin</cite> argues for a later creation date for that work
than is usually given. See, for example, @WaterMarginDate.{%endfn%}

<blockquote lang="zh">盖宋江等皆大盗，详见《宣和遗事》及《癸辛杂识》。</blockquote>

> Protector of Righteousness Sòng Jiāng and others are all thieves. For details,
> see <cite lang="zh-Latn">Xuānhé Yíshì</cite> and <cite lang="zh-Latn">Guǐxīn
> Záshí</cite>.

Indeed, the characters listed on the ‘myriads’ cards are all taken from the book <cite
lang="zh">宣和遺事</cite> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Xuānhé Yíshì</span>
(“Neglected Events of the Xuanhe Reign”), a story published <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr> 1300 that would
be one of the main sources of the later, more famous, book <cite lang="zh">水滸傳</cite>
<span lang="zh-latn" class="noun">Shuǐhǔzhuàn</span>, commonly known in English as
<cite>Water Margin</cite>.

in <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Xuānhé Yíshì</span> (hereafter <abbr
class="initialism">XHYS</abbr>), <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Sòng
Jiāng</span> has only 36 bandit-followers, unlike the 108 bandits that appear in
<cite>Water Margin</cite>.{%fn%}It is tempting to suggest, given that there are
38 cards in the deck and actually 38 bandit characters in <abbr class="initialism">XHYS</abbr> — 36 along with
their leader <span lang="zh" class="noun">Sòng Jiāng</span>, as well as <span
lang="zh" class="noun">Zhāng Héng</span>, who is not part of the core group but
joins later, and does appear in <span class="noun" lang="zh-Latn">Lù
Róng</span>’s list — that originally every card had a corresponding figure.
However, without further evidence this must remain a remote
possibility.{%endfn%} The differences between the list of bandits that appears
on the deck and in <cite>Water Margin</cite> are as follows:{%fn%}It is worth
noting that most of the changes that are listed here as occurring in <cite>Water
Margin</cite> are also present in the earlier <cite lang="zh">宋江三十六人赞
</cite> <cite>Encomium to <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Sòng Jiāng</span>
and his Thirty-Six</cite>, a poem from the Yuan period by <span lang="zh">龚开
</span> [<span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Gong
Kai</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_Kai) (1222–1307). The only change
 that doesn’t appear is that <span lang="zh">呼延绰</span> <span lang="zh-Latn"
class="noun">Hūyán Chuò</span> still retains his name in
<cite>Encomium</cite>.{%endfn%}

<dd><span lang="zh">张横</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Zhāng Héng</span>’s nickname is given as “Ten Feet of Steel”, which is his nickname in <abbr class="initialism">XHYS</abbr>, instead of “Boatman”, his nickname in <abbr class="initialism">WM</abbr>. In <abbr class="initialism">WM</abbr>, “Ten Feet of Steel” is the nickname given to a different character, <span lang="zh">扈三娘</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Hù Sānniáng</span>.</dd>

<dt><span lang="zh">八十萬貫</span> 80MC</dt>
<dd>This is the hardest divergence to explain, as <span lang="zh">李進</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Jìn</span> is not a character that appears in <abbr class="initialism">XHYS</abbr>, and the nickname given is a duplicate of the 6MC card. However, there is a <span lang="zh">李進義</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Jìnyì</span> in <abbr class="initialism">XHYS</abbr>,{%fn%}Who has the same nickname <span lang="zh">玉麒麟</span> “Jade Qilin” as <span lang="zh">盧俊義</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lú Jùnyì</span> in <abbr class="initialism">WM</abbr>.{%endfn%} which could be the origin of the name. A possible explanation for the doubled “River Dragon” nickname is that a later copyist or copyists who were familiar with <abbr class="initialism">WM</abbr> became confused about the names and conflated several different characters, truncating a hypothetical original <span lang="zh">李進義</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Jìnyì</span> into <span lang="zh">李進</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Jìn</span> and then giving him <span lang="zh">李俊</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Jùn</span>’s <abbr class="initialism">WM</abbr> nickname in an effort to “correct” the text. More research into different editions of <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lù Róng</span>’s text, or intermediate texts between <abbr class="initialism">XHYS</abbr> and <abbr class="initialism">WM</abbr> may give a better answer.{%fn%}The <cite>Encomium</cite> mentioned above doesn’t seem to shed any light here.{%endfn%}</dd>
</dl>

The remainder of the cards have characters that are present in both <abbr class="initialism">XHYS</abbr> and <abbr class="initialism">WM</abbr>, with identical epithets.


### <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Pān Zhīhéng</span>’s Water Margin deck

<span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Pān Zhīhéng</span> (<span lang="zh">潘之恒
</span> 1556–1622)  was a late Ming era poet who provided the next full
description of a money-suited deck, published at the end of the Ming dynasty
about 1621–1644. 

Once again, I reproduce the list below, and the original Chinese text can be
reconstructed by reading across each row. In addition to the information
provided by <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lù Róng</span>, <span
lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Pān Zhīhéng</span> also lists the character’s
corresponding stars and adds some additional notes for some of the cards. Three
of the cards are noted as having “two heads”. This information may have been
useful for playing the game <span lang="zh">鬥雙頭</span> <span lang="zh-Latn"
class="noun">Dòu Shuāng Tóu</span> “competing [for?/with?] two heads”, which is
mentioned by <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Pān Zhīhéng</span> in the same
text. Unfortunately, no rules are recorded for this game.

When we look at the list of characters described by <span lang="zh-Latn"
class="noun">Pān Zhīhéng</span> we see some interesting things. By this stage
the characters contained in the deck have been updated or replaced and are now
wholly drawn from <cite>Water Margin</cite>’s lists. It seems that the intent of
the changes was to harmonize the deck with the content of <abbr
class="initialism">WM</abbr>, as each of the 5 “divergences” from <abbr
class="initialism">WM</abbr> mentioned above has been corrected:

1. <span lang="zh">八十萬貫</span> 80MC: The possibly “corrupted” name of <span lang="zh">李進</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Jìn</span> discussed above is replaced entirely by that of <span lang="zh">朱仝</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Zhū Tóng</span>.
2. <span lang="zh">六十萬貫</span> 60MC: <span lang="zh">呼延绰</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Hūyán Chuò</span> is replaced by the <abbr class="initialism">WM</abbr> equivalent, <span lang="zh">呼延灼</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Hūyán Zhuó</span>.
3. <span lang="zh">二十萬貫</span> 20MC: The name of <span lang="zh">張橫</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Zhāng Héng</span> is replaced by <span lang="zh">扈三娘</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Hù Sānniáng</span> who in <abbr class="initialism">WM</abbr> has the same epithet <span lang="zh">一丈青</span> “Ten Feet of Steel” that <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Zhāng Héng</span> has in <abbr class="initialism">XHYS</abbr>.

Then there is something of a dance amongst three cards:

1. <span lang="zh">六萬貫</span> 6MC: <span lang="zh">李海</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Hǎi</span> (who becomes <span lang="zh">李俊</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Jùn</span> in WM) is replaced by <span lang="zh">史進</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Shǐ Jìn</span>.{%fn%}Interestingly, this name is similar to the removed “corrupted” <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Jìn</span>.{%endfn%}
2. <span lang="zh">李逵</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Kuí</span> is replaced by <span lang="zh">李俊</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Jùn</span>,
3. and <span lang="zh">四十萬貫</span> 40MC: <span lang="zh">王雄</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Wáng Xióng</span> is replaced by <span lang="zh">李逵</span> <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Lǐ Kuí</span>.

### The Water Margin deck after <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Pān Zhīhéng</span>

From <span lang="zh-Latn" class="noun">Pān Zhīhéng</span> onwards the set of
characters seems to be remarkably stable. In most of the decks derived from
Chinese money-suited cards, the tens of myriads suit has been removed, but the
myriads suit remains in the same order. It is often very hard to determine which
cards are which as the names have mostly been dropped, but it is possible to
identify characters by their customary attributes:

* The easiest character to identify is Zhu Tong, who is almost always depicted
  with a young child. He remains on the 8M card in all derived decks.
* Li Kui is often identifiable as well. He is either depicted with a child (in
  fact the same child associated with Zhu Tong; in the book he ends up murdering
  the child) or with a pair of axes, his chosen weapon.
* Ruǎn Xiǎowǔ depicted with a flower in his cap (according to Pan Zhiheng,
  op.cit. p. 93)
