Gough mentions having a deck of these, @GoughIntroduction [p. 171]:

> I have authority in my own poſſesſſion for ſaying that the Chineſe uſe cards marked and ſorted in ſuits like thoſe of Europe, not only from a Chineſe painting where their ladies are repreſented playing at a game with ſomething much thicker in ſubſtance than cards,{%fn%}A domino tile game of some kind. Note that {%gameref mahjong%} had not yet been invented.{%endfn%} but ſhaped and numbered like them. One of theſe has on it *ſix ace*, anodhter *ſix* as on the cards called *Domino* cards among us. But I have alſo a pack of Chineſe cards made of the ſame materials as European, and charged with various devices to no great or regular nubmers. The whole pack conſiſts only of thirty cards, and of theſe nine have human faces, one whole length figures, and one two faces one under the other.{%fn%}This is the Zhu Tong card.{%endfn%} The whole length figure has on it a red ſtamp with characters, and there are two ſuch ſtamps on one of the faces.
