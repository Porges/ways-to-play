# Chinese Cards

As the probable country of origin of playing cards, China has a long history of
card-playing and many different varieties.

The pan-Chinese word for playing cards, <span lang="zh">牌</span> (Standard Mandarin Chinese: <Pronounce lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" pronouncer="LofZRules" file="pronunciation_zh_牌.mp3">pái</Pronounce>), does not distinguish between different forms of card-like games and equally applies to paper or cardboard cards, bamboo sticks, or bone, ivory, or plastic Mahjong tiles.

In many adjacent countries and languages adjacent to China, it seems that a derived or related term is used in the local language (although, I am not a linguist!). Below I list some examples, ordered by number of speakers (speaker count derived from Wikipedia):

* Chinese: <span lang="zh">牌</span> — Mandarin (1.1 billion) <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">pái</span>, Cantonese (85M) <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">paai⁴</span>, Hokkien (20M?) <span lang="nan-Latn-pehoeji">pâi</span>, Teochew (15M?) <span lang="nan-Latn-pengim">bai⁵</span>, Wu <span lang="wuu-Latn">⁶ba</span>

Unusually, Japan does not use cards derived from Chinese examples, but instead
from European (specifically Portuguese) cards (see [the page about Japanese cards](articles/cards/japan/japan.md) for more).

## Types of cards

The many types of Chinese and Chinese-derived cards can be broken down into several broad categories, as follows.

🚧 The categorization here is a work in progress and may change, especially the last section. 🚧

Those derived from **[<span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" class="noun">Xiàngqí</span>](games/xiangqi/xiangqi.md)** (“Chinese chess”):
* [Four-Colour cards](articles/cards/china/four-colour-cards/four-colour-cards.md) (<span lang="zh">四色牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">sì sè pái</span>)
* Two-Coloured chess cards, including:
  * Red cards (<span lang="zh">紅牌</span>), also called Double Gold cards (<span lang="zh">雙金牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">shuāng jīn pái</span>)
  * Malaysian <span lang="ms" class="noun">Chap Ji Kee</span>
  * Vietnamese Chrysanthemum cards, <span lang="vi">bài tam cúc</span>

Those derived from **dice**:
* Chinese dominoes (<span lang="zh">天九牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">tiān jiǔ pái</span>)
* 15-Point Cards (<span lang="zh">十五湖</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">shíwǔ hú</span>)
* Sichuan domino cards (<span lang="zh">川牌</span>)
