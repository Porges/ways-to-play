As the probable country of origin of playing cards, China has a long history of
card-playing and many different varieties.

The pan-Chinese word for playing cards, <span lang="zh">牌</span> (Standard Mandarin Chinese: <Pronounce lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" pronouncer="LofZRules" file="pronunciation_zh_牌.mp3">pái</Pronounce>), does not distinguish between different forms of card-like games and equally applies to paper or cardboard cards, bamboo sticks, or bone, ivory, or plastic Mahjong tiles. In many adjacent countries and languages adjacent to China, a derived or related term is used in the local language. Below I list some examples, ordered by number of speakers:

* Chinese: <span lang="zh">牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">pái</span> (Mandarin)
* Vietnamese: <span lang="vi">bài</span> [76M]

Unusually, Japan does not use cards derived from Chinese examples, but instead
from European (specifically Portuguese) cards (see {%a japan, the page about
Japanese cards %} for more).

## Types of cards

The many types of Chinese and Chinese-derived cards can be broken down into several broad categories, as follows.

🚧 The categorization here is a work in progress and may change, especially the last section. 🚧

Those derived from **[Xiàngqí](games/xiangqi.md)** (“Chinese chess”):
* [Four-Colour cards](articles/cards/china/four-colour-cards/four-colour-cards.md) (<span lang="zh">四色牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">sì sè pái</span>)
* Two-Coloured chess cards, including:
  * Red cards (<span lang="zh">紅牌</span>), also called Double Gold cards (<span lang="zh">雙金牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">shuāng jīn pái</span>)
  * Malaysian <span lang="ms" class="noun">Chap Ji Kee</span>
  * Vietnamese Chrysanthemum cards, <span lang="vi">bài tam cúc</span>
  
Those derived from **dice**:
* Chinese dominoes (<span lang="zh">天九牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">tiān jiǔ pái</span>)
* 15-Point Cards (<span lang="zh">十五湖</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">shíwǔ hú</span>)
