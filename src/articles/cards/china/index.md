<!--excerpt-->

The pan-Chinese word for playing cards, <span lang="zh">牌</span> (Standard
Chinese: {%pronounce lang="zh-Latn-pinyin" word="pái" pronouncer="LofZRules"
file="pronunciation_zh_牌.mp3" %}), does not distinguish between different forms
of card-like games and equally applies to paper or cardboard cards, bamboo
sticks, or bone, ivory, or plastic Mahjong tiles. In many adjacent countries a
derived term is used in the local language:

* Burmese: <span lang="my">ဖဲ</span> (<span lang="my-Latn">hpai</span>)
* Khmer: <span lang="km">បៀ</span> ({% pronounce lang="km-Latn" word="bie"
  file="pronunciation_km_បៀ.mp3" pronouncer="chetanachey" %})
* Thai: <span lang="th">ไพ่</span> ({% pronounce lang="th-Latn" word="pâi"
  file="pronunciation_th_ไพ.mp3" pronouncer="Ghee" %})
* Vietnamese: <span lang="vi">bài</span>

Unusually, Japan does not use cards derived from Chinese examples, but instead
from European (specifically Portuguese) cards (see {%a japan, the page about
Japanese cards %} for more).

The many types of Chinese and Chinese-derived cards can be broken down into
several broad categories:

* those derived from {% gameref xiangqi %} (“Chinese chess”):
  * Four-Colour Cards (<span lang="zh">四色牌</span>)
  * Two-Coloured chess cards, including:
    * Double Gold Cards (<span lang="zh">雙金牌</span>)
