The pan-Chinese word for playing cards, <span lang="zh">牌</span> (Standard
Chinese: {%pronounce lang="zh-Latn-pinyin" word="pái" pronouncer="LofZRules"
file="pronunciation_zh_牌.mp3" %}), does not distinguish between different forms
of card-like games and equally applies to paper or cardboard cards, bamboo
sticks, or bone, ivory, or plastic Mahjong tiles. In many adjacent countries and
languages adjacent to China, a derived term is used in the local language:

Unusually, Japan does not use cards derived from Chinese examples, but instead
from European (specifically Portuguese) cards (see {%a japan, the page about
Japanese cards %} for more).

The many types of Chinese and Chinese-derived cards can be broken down into
several broad categories:

* those derived from {% gameref xiangqi %} (“Chinese chess”):
  * Four-Colour Cards (<span lang="zh">四色牌</span>)
  * Two-Coloured chess cards, including:
    * Double Gold Cards (<span lang="zh">雙金牌</span>)
    * Malaysian <span lang="ms" class="noun">Chap Ji Kee</span>
    * Vietnamese Chrysanthemum cards (<span lang="vt" class="noun">Bài Tam Cúc</span>)
* those derived from dice (dominoes):
  * Chinese dominoes (Tien Gow)
  * 15-Point Cards
* those derived from paper money/banknotes:
  * Four-Suited money cards
    * Ma Diao
    * Hakka playing cards
    * Vietnamese <span lang="vt" class="noun">Bài Bất</span>
  * Three-Suited money cards, also used in Thailand. Derived cards include:
    * {%a ceki,Ceki cards%} (Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia)
    * Mahjong
    * Vietnamese <span lang="vt" class="noun">Bài Tổ Tôm</span>
