The pan-Chinese word for playing cards, <span lang="zh">牌</span> (Standard
Chinese: {%pronounce lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" word="pái" pronouncer="LofZRules"
file="pronunciation_zh_牌.mp3" %}), does not distinguish between different forms
of card-like games and equally applies to paper or cardboard cards, bamboo
sticks, or bone, ivory, or plastic Mahjong tiles. In many adjacent countries and
languages adjacent to China, a derived or related term is used in the local
language. Below I list some examples, ordered by number of speakers:

Unusually, Japan does not use cards derived from Chinese examples, but instead
from European (specifically Portuguese) cards (see {%a japan, the page about
Japanese cards %} for more).

The many types of Chinese and Chinese-derived cards can be broken down into several broad categories, as follows.

⚠️ The categorization here is a work in progress and may change, especially the last section.

* {%a four-colour-cards %} (<span lang="zh">四色牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">sì sè pái</span>)
* Two-Coloured chess cards, including:
  * Red cards (<span lang="zh">紅牌</span>), also called Double Gold cards (<span lang="zh">雙金牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">shuāng jīn pái</span>)
  * Malaysian <span lang="ms" class="noun">Chap Ji Kee</span>
  * Vietnamese Chrysanthemum cards, <span lang="vi">bài tam cúc</span>
  
Those derived from **dice**:

  * Six red cards (<span lang="zh">六紅牌</span> <span lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin">liù hóng pái</span>)
