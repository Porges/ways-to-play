<!--excerpt-->

The pan-Chinese word for playing cards, <span lang="zh">牌</span> (Standard
Chinese: {%pronounce lang="cmn-Latn-pinyin" word="pái" pronouncer="LofZRules"
file="pronunciation_zh_牌.mp3" %}), does not distinguish between different forms
of card-like games and equally applies to paper or cardboard cards, bamboo
sticks, or bone, ivory, or plastic Mahjong tiles. In many adjacent countries and
languages adjacent to China, a derived or related term is used in the local
language. Below I list some examples, ordered by number of speakers:

Unusually, Japan does not use cards derived from Chinese examples, but instead
from European (specifically Portuguese) cards (see {%a japan, the page about
Japanese cards %} for more).
