Manufacturing of playing cards in New Zealand started in the 1880s. Despite this
early start, there have not been many manufacturers of playing-cards.

The main “lines” of manufacturers described below are (or were):

* [John Dickinson/Croxley](#john-dickinsoncroxley)
* [A. D. Willis/Weeks Ltd./United Empire Box/Amcor](#a-d-willisweeks-ltdunited-empire-boxamcor)
* [Strong & Ready/Tanner Couch](#strong-andamp-readytanner-couch)

## Tax Stamps

Playing cards imported into New Zealand were taxed from 1860, and stamped from
1880 until the tax ended in 1930.[@TaxStampNZ] All examples I have
seen have been stamped on the <Cards>d2</Cards>.

## Manufacturers

### John Dickinson/Croxley

{%aside%}
The original John Dickinson/Croxley factory (known as “Croxley house”) still
stands in Wellington and was turned into [an apartment
building](https://custance.co.nz/project/croxley-mills-apartments) in the early 2000s.
{%endaside%}

John Dickinson was a stationery company based in the United Kingdom that opened
a New Zealand branch (“John Dickinson & Co.”) in 1920.[@CroxleyHistory]
“Croxley” was their public brand of stationery products in New Zealand (the UK
company originated in [Croxley
Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croxley_Green)), under which they also
published playing cards. As far as I know, the UK company never manufactured
cards.

> ```yaml

> position: left

> The Joker card (with the non-pictorial decks) remains unchanged throughout the years, aside from reproduction infelicities.


In 1966 the UK company merged with E. S. & A. Robinson to form
“Dickinson–Robinson Group”; the New Zealand firm was renamed to “The Dickinson
Robinson Group” for a few months from 19 Dec 1968 – 26 Mar 1969, and then “DRG
(New Zealand) Limited” until they were liquidated in 1994.[@DRGCompany]

Croxley remained around as its own company, but closed its last manufacturing
plant in 2005.[@CroxleyClosing] The brand itself still exists, being owned by
OfficeMax. However, it may soon disappear forever as OfficeMax closed all of its
New Zealand stores in late 2020,[^fn0] and is now
online-only. Current Croxley cards appear to be made in China and only retain
the Ace as a nod to the Dickinson line.

[^fn0]: A victim of Covid-19.

The aces have changed over the years to match the name of the company; the later
aces are often poor copies of the earlier ones, where detail has been lost.

The earlier (pre-DRG) cards are most easily identified by a <Cards>J</Cards> index which has a turned-in tail, but this feature is lost in the DRG cards which shifted to a sans-serif index.

The curled-<Cards>J</Cards> index on the pre-DRG cards is useful in identifying
tourist pictorial decks where the card images are replaced by photographs of
scenic locations, so that the Ace gives no identifying information. The
following cards are from a deck produced before 1958:

The Dickinson and DRG cards are probably most often found with backs designed
for tourists, depicting locations around New Zealand, or New Zealand wildlife:

> Archibald Dudingston Willis, circa 1902.

Archibald Dudingston Willis (1842–1908)[@ADWillis_IPCS] was a very early manufacturer of playing cards in New Zealand who operated in Wanganui from the 1880s. In 1951 the company was sold to Weeks Ltd, which kept A. D. Willis as a subsidiary, and the business was sold in turn to United Empire Box (UEB) around 1964.[@AstuteBusinessman][^fn1] In the late 1980s the design was taken over by Kiwi Packaging (part of Amcor). This line of designs now appears to be out-of-print, as Amcor no longer manufacture playing cards.

[^fn1]: Some sources (including [@ADWillis_IPCS]) state 1949 here, but 1951 is corroborated by newspaper reports.[@AYearOfExpansion]

### Foreign manufacturers

In addition to cards manufactured in New Zealand, cards featuring New Zealand
scenes were manufactured in other countries, such as the United Kingdom.
