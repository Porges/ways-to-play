# Hunt Games

Hunt games are a family of games where two unequal forces are controlled by different players. In most games the smaller force has more powerful pieces, and the larger force wins by trapping or pinning the smaller force.

## Examples

- [Fox & Geese](games/fox-and-geese/fox-and-geese.md) is the most typical version of this game.
- [Assault](games/assault/assault.md) is a combination of a hunt game and an [attainment game](articles/families/attainment-games/attainment-games.md).
