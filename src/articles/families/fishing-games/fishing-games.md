Fishing games are a family of card games where players play cards from their hand to attempt to capture cards that are face-up on the table, in a shared ‘pool’.

## Categorization

I believe they can be divided into three broad groups, in increasing order of luck:

1. games where cards are played only from the hand,
2. games where cards are played from both hand and stock,
3. and games where cards are played only from the stock.

For the first type, where cards are only played from the hand, games include:

- [Cassino](games/cassino/cassino.md)
- [Laugh and Lie Down](games/laugh-and-lie-down/laugh-and-lie-down.md)

In games where cards are played from both hand and stock, after playing a card from the hand (and making any captures), the player turns a second card from the stock and attempts to capture cards with it. These games are popular in East Asia. Games of this type include:

- played with two-colour chess cards: 
    - [Fishing for Hairtails](games/fishing-for-hairtails/fishing-for-hairtails.md)
- played with [[Ceki|Ceki cards]]:
    - {% gameref cholek-tiga %}
    - {% gameref enthit %}
    - {% gameref thothit %}
    - {% gameref thothit-kuna %}
- many [Hanafuda](articles/cards/japan/hanafuda/hanafuda.md) games (which I have yet to document) also fall into this category

The last type are luck-based games where all cards are turned from the stock.  These are commonly gambling or children’s games:

- played with standard cards:
    - [Kings](games/kings/kings.md)
- played with [Ceki cards](articles/cards/ceki/ceki.md):
    - {% gameref thothit-yogyakarta %}
    - {% gameref thit-thit-dulit %}
