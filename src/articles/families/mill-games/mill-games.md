<p class="lead">Mill games are a family of boardgames also known as <em>Morris</em> or
<em>Merels</em> games. The main aim of any mill game is to try to form a row of
three pieces, which is called a ‘mill’, and which usually allows the player to
remove one of the opponent’s pieces from the board (usually not from another
mill).</p>

{/* excerpt */}

Most mill games are split into two phases of *placement* and *movement*, so that
all pieces are placed on the board before any pieces are moved.

## Games

Many of the games overlap so much that they could be considered to be the same game. For example, [Morabaraba](games/morabaraba/morabaraba.md) as standardized by Mind Sports South Africa has only two small differences from [Twelve Men’s Morris](games/nine-mens-morris/nine-mens-morris.md#Twelve%20Men’s%20Morris) as standardized by the <span class="noun" lang="de">Weltmühlespiel Dachverband</span>. However, I have chosen to describe it separately due to the interesting history and cultural context around the game.

The most important representative of the type is [Nine Men’s Morris](games/nine-mens-morris/nine-mens-morris.md), and it is a good place to start if you have never played this type of game
before.

### Games on the large mill board

* [Morabaraba](games/morabaraba/morabaraba.md) is a mill game played competitively in South Africa. It differs slightly from Twelve Men’s Morris.
* [Nine Men’s Morris](games/nine-mens-morris/nine-mens-morris.md) is the most well-known, and can be viewed as the stereotypical mill game. Many variants are described on this page.
* [Twelve Men’s Morris](games/nine-mens-morris/nine-mens-morris.md#Twelve%20Men’s%20Morris) is the most common form in the United States. Eleven Men’s Morris is a variant with one fewer piece per player.
* [Shax](games/shax/shax.md) is a mill game from Somalia. It is distinguished by not permitting capturing during the placement phase.

### Games on the medium mill board

* [Achi](games/achi/achi.md) is a game from West Africa that features an additional way to form a mill.
* [Five Men’s Morris] or [Six Men’s Morris] is a mid-sized version that is less common than the bigger or smaller games.

### Games on the small mill board

* [Three Men’s Morris](games/three-mens-morris/three-mens-morris.md) is a simple mill game that is known around the world.
* [Tic-Tac-Toe](games/tic-tac-toe/tic-tac-toe.md) can be viewed as a degenerate mill game (and could derive from Three Men’s Morris?)

### Other mill boards

* [Tri-Hex](games/tri-hex/tri-hex.md) uses a non-standard board derived from that of tic-tac-toe.
