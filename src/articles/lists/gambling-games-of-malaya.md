@GamblingGamesOfMalaya is a book written by one C. T. Dobree (Charles Thomas Winston Dobr√©e), who was at one time Assistant Commissioner of Police in Malaya. Dobree intended it to be useful for identifying games for the purposes of deciding whether or not a particular game was legal, and it remains a very valuable source for information on games which have been played throughout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_Archipelago">Malay archipelago.</a>
