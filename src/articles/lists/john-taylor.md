[John Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_(poet)) (1578–1653) was
an English poet who gave himself the epithet “the Water-Poet”. His work
<cite>Taylor’s Motto</cite> was published in 1621, and contains a list of games in one verse, as follows:

> The Prodigals estate, like to a flux,\
> The Mercer, Draper, and the Silkman sucks:\
> The Taylor, Millainer, Dogs, Drabs and Dice,\
> Trey-trip, or Passage, or The most at thrice;\
> At Irish, Tick-tack, Doublets, Draughts or Chesse,\

> At One and thirty, or at Poore and rich,\
> Ruffe, slam, Trump, nody, whisk, hole, Sant, Newcut.\
