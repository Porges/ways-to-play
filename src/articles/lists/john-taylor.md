[John Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_(poet)) (1578–1653) was
an English poet who gave himself the epithet “the Water-Poet”. His work
<cite>Taylor’s Motto</cite> was published in 1621, and contains a list of games, as follows:

<blockquote>
The Prodigals estate, like to a flux,<br/>
The Mercer, Draper, and the Silkman sucks:<br/>
The Taylor, Millainer, Dogs, Drabs and Dice,<br/>
Trey-trip, or Passage, or The most at thrice;<br/>
At Irish, Tick-tack, Doublets, Draughts or Chesse,<br/>
He flings his money free with carelessenesse:<br/>
At Nouum, Mumchance, mischance, (chuse ye which<br/>
At One and thirty, or at Poore and rich,<br/>
Ruffe, slam, Trump, nody, whisk, hole, Sant, Newcut.<br/>
Vnto the keeping of foure Knaues he'le put<br/>
His whole estate, at Loadum, or at Gleeke<br/>
At Tickle-me-quickly, he's a merry Greeke,<br/>
At Primefisto, Post and payre, Primero,<br/>
Maw, Whip-her-ginny, he•s a lib'rall Hero;<br/>
At My-sow-pigg'd, and (Reader neuer doubt ye,<br/>
He's skil'd in all games, except) Looke about ye.<br/>
Bowles, shoue-groate, tennis, no game comes amis,<br/>
His purse a nurse for any body is;<br/>
Caroches, Coaches, and Tobacconists,<br/>
All sorts of people freely from his fists<br/>
His vaine expences daily sucke and soake,<br/>
And his himselfe sucks onely drinke and smoake,<br/>
And thus the Prodigall, himselfe alone,<br/>
Giues suck to thousands, and himselfe sucks none.[@TaylorsMotto]
