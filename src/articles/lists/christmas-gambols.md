This poem by an otherwise unnamed “Boughton, Esq.” is featured in @PoeticalAmusementsBath2 [126–30] and contains reference to a number of games which were apparently at risk of being forgotten at the time the poem was written — however the poem is actually a sequence of sexual references.

> As Christmas Gambols are our theme,<br/>
> &emsp;Let’s search through good old times,<br/>
> And skim, where’er we can, the cream<br/>
> &emsp;Of Gambols, for our rhymes.
>
> Full many a good old game’s forgot,<br/>
> &emsp;In these insipid days,<br/>
> Which, if old folks believ’d may be,<br/>
> &emsp;Well worthy were of praise.
>
> ’Twas in that merry Monarch’s reign,<br/>
> &emsp;When Charles o’er Britain sway’d,<br/>
> Court dames, and lords of high renown,<br/>
> &emsp;Each night some Gambol play’d.
>
> I have premis’d, ’twas ancient times<br/>
> &emsp;When kings such games did choose,<br/>
> At _Westminster_ each night to play<br/>
> &emsp;_The Royal Game of Goose_.
> 
> Oft would the king with beauteous dame,<br/>
> &emsp;Carouse it o’er the bowl,[^fn0]<br/>
> And then would play the sprightly game,<br/>
> &emsp;’Yclept _[My Lady’s Hole](games/my-ladys-hole/my-ladys-hole.md)_.
>
> We’ll visit now the City dames,<br/>
> &emsp;The aldermen and mayor;<br/>
> The frequent pranks that here are play’d,<br/>
> &emsp;Makes Christmas _all the year_.
> 
> Ah ! could their worships but divine,<br/>
> &emsp;Where their fine ladies go,<br/>
> Each neighbour might, to play agree<br/>
> &emsp;At _Cuckolds All-a-Row_.
>
> The Town to quit for Country sports,[^fn1]<br/>
> &emsp;Will give us better cheer:<br/>
> The pastimes we’ll not all recite,<br/>
> &emsp;That’s play’d in _Bed-fordshire_.[^fn2]
>
> At villages and market towns,<br/>
> &emsp;The lads the lasses wheedle,<br/>
> Each evening in the holidays,<br/>
> &emsp;To play at _Thread my Needle_.
>
> But when the weather proves unkind,<br/>
> &emsp;As oft these times betide,<br/>
> Some parties play at _Blind Man’s Buff_,<br/>
> &emsp;And others _Hoopers-hide_.
>
> Full many a lass _this game_ doth rue,<br/>
> &emsp;Both rich as well as poor,<br/>
> Far better had they learnt to play<br/>
> &emsp;At _Beat Knave out of Door_.[^fn3]
>
> Whilst in the parlour cards are play’d,<br/>
> &emsp;Or novels shall be read,<br/>
> The servant shall the _Slipper hunt_[^fn4]<br/>
> &emsp;And mould the _Cockle Bread_.[^fn5]
>
> Each lady has her hobby-horse,<br/>
> &emsp;Few men without their poney;<br/>
> May _Laugh and lie down_ be my lot,[^fn6]<br/>
> &emsp;With _Loo, and Matrimony_.
> 
> And, now I’ve done, this boon I crave,<br/>
> &emsp;’Twill make my Muse to amble,<br/>
> (For tir’d she is) a sprig you’ll give,<br/>
> &emsp;_The Master of the Gambol_.

[^fn5]: “Young Wenches have a wanton sport which they call _moulding of Cocklebread: viz._ they gett upon a Table-board, and then gather-up their knees and their coates with their hands as high as they can, and then they wabble to and fro with their Buttocks as if they were kneading of Dowgh with their A[rse], and say these words, _viz._—‘My Dame is sick and gonne to bed/And I’le go mowld my Cockle-bread’.”[@RemainsOfGentilisme 43] This was apparently a remnant of a older folk-magic in which such _fundamentally_-kneaded bread would be served to the object of the girl’s desire, in order to secure their love.[@RemainsOfGentilisme 225] See also “cockle-bread” in @SexualShakespeare1 [264].
