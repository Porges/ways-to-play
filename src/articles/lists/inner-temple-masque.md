<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Middleton">Thomas Middleton</a>’s <cite>The Inner-Temple Masque, or Masque of Heroes</cite> features a scene in which a farcical “will of Christmas” is read, which contains allusions to several games that were current at the time.[@InnerTempleMasque]

The will is read aloud while the character “Plum” interjects:

[^fn0]: i.e., Christmas

[^jonson]: This is possibly a reference to Ben Jonson’s [<cite>Christmas, His Masque</cite>](https://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Poetry/christmas_his_masque.htm) (1616), where ten children of Christmas are named, “Gamboll” amongst them.
