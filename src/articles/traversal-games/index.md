A traversal game is a type of board game where the goal is to move your pieces
from a starting location into a different position or configuration on the
board. Capture of pieces is not usually a feature of these types of games.

The most famous example of this kind of game is probably {% gameref halma %}, or
especially one of its descendents, such as “Chinese Checkers”.
