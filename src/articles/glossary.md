Here I collect some terms instead of reëxplaining them in many articles, as well as providing a place for discussion or expansion.

<dt>eyes</dt>
<dd>

A group of cards in {% gameref kanhu %} is called an ‘eye’ (<span lang="zh">眼</span> Cantonese: <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">ngaan⁵</span>).[@CulinMahjong p. 156] In other games combinations are called called ‘ox’ (<span lang="zh">牛</span> Cantonese: <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">ngau⁴</span>).[@GamblingGamesOfMalaya p. 88] I wonder if both terms are derived by modifying ‘pair’ (<span lang="zh">偶</span> Cantonese: <span lang="yue-Latn-jyutping">ngau⁵</span>)?[@TonicDictionary p. 323]

In Mahjong the ‘eye’ is the pair that is required to make a complete hand.

<dt>tong</dt>
<dd>
Payment made to the owner of a gambling establishment, as a fixed fee per game or as a percentage of winnings.

- This is possibly from the Chinese <span lang="zh">筒</span> (Hokkien: <span lang="nan-Latn">tông</span>), a round thing, a barrel or can (in which to place the payments). As a verb it means to place or put in.
- In Javan usage the <span lang="jav-Latn">tong</span> was the glass in which the contributions to the gaming house (called <span lang="jav">ꦕꦸꦕꦸꦏ꧀</span> <span lang="jav-Latn">cucuk</span> or <span lang="jav">ꦕꦸꦏ꧀</span> <span lang="jav-Latn">cuk</span>) are placed.[@JavaanseKaartspelen p. 4]
- In Thai it is <span lang="th">ต๋ง</span> (<span lang="th-Latn">tong</span>).
- Also used in Australia amongst Aboriginal groups who play {% gameref kuns %}.[@ANoteOnKuns p. 42]
